six 3U nano-satellites hosting a new miniaturized detector, HERMES-TP/SP aims
at the detection and accurate localisation of bright high-energy transients

resolution and the wide field of view that characterize the detectors of the
constellation represent the key features for the next generation high-energy
all-sky monitor with good localisation capabilities that will play a pivotal
role in the future of Multi-messenger Astronomy. In this work, we will describe
in detail the temporal techniques that allow the localisation of bright
transient events taking advantage of their almost simultaneous observation by

atmospheres of low-mass, temperate exoplanets with the direct-imaging
technique. This will be a major step forward in our understanding of exoplanet
diversity and the prevalence of potentially habitable conditions beyond the
Earth. We compute a list of currently known exoplanets detectable with the
mid-infrared Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) in thermal emission. We
also compute the list of known exoplanets accessible to a notional design of
the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), observing in reflected starlight. With
a pre-existing method, we processed the NASA Exoplanet Archive and computed
orbital realizations for each known exoplanet. We derived their mass, radius,
equilibrium temperature, and planet-star angular separation. We used the
LIFEsim simulator to compute the integration time ($t_{int}$) required to
detect each planet with LIFE. A planet is considered detectable if a broadband
signal-to-noise ratio $S/N$=7 is achieved over the spectral range $4-18.5\mu$m
in $t_{int}\leq$100 hours. We tested whether the planet is accessible to HWO in
reflected starlight based on its notional inner and outer working angles, and
minimum planet-to-star contrast. LIFE's reference configuration (four 2-m
telescopes with 5% throughput and a nulling baseline between 10-100 m) can
detect 212 known planets within 20 pc. Of these, 55 are also accessible to HWO
in reflected starlight, offering a unique opportunity for synergies in
atmospheric characterization. LIFE can also detect 32 known transiting
exoplanets. Furthermore, 38 LIFE-detectable planets orbit in the habitable
zone, of which 13 with $M_p<5M_\oplus$ and 8 with $5M_\oplus<M_p<10M_\oplus$.
LIFE already has enough targets to perform ground-breaking analyses of

  SiC grains from AGB stars","Individual mainstream stardust silicon carbide (SiC) grains and a
SiC-enriched bulk sample from the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite have been
analyzed by the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe - Reverse Geometry
(SHRIMP-RG) for Eu isotopes. The mainstream grains are believed to have
condensed in the outflows of 1.5 to 3 Msun carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars with close-to-solar metallicity. The 151Eu fractions [fr(151Eu) =
151Eu/(151Eu+153Eu)] derived from our measurements are compared with previous
astronomical observations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars enriched
in elements made by slow neutron captures (the s-process). Despite the
difference in metallicity between the parent stars of the grains and the
metal-poor stars, the fr(151Eu) values derived from our measurements agree well
with fr(151Eu) values derived from astronomical observations. We have also
compared the SiC data with theoretical predictions of the evolution of Eu
isotopic ratios in the envelope of AGB stars. Because of the low Eu abundances
in the SiC grains, the fr(151Eu) values derived from our measurements show
large uncertainties, being in most cases larger than the difference between
solar and predicted fr(151Eu) values. The SiC aggregate yields a fr(151Eu)
value within the range observed in the single grains and provides a more
precise result (fr(151Eu) = 0.54 +/- 0.03, 95 percent conf.), but is
approximately 12 percent higher than current s-process predictions. The AGB
models can match the SiC data if we use an improved formalism to evaluate the

  of gravitational singularities","With this note we want to point out that already in the early days of
cosmology it was understood that negative pressure could eliminate
gravitational singularities in a natural way e.g. E.B. Gliner, Sov. Phys. JETP
22(1966)378 and M.A. Markov, Pis'ma Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 36, No 6, 214-216 (20
Sept. 1982). Today, with the discovery of dark energy and the strong evidence
in favor of an inflationary start of the Big Bang, the existence of negative
pressure is widely accepted. In fundamental physics, phase transitions are
generally thought to be reversible (Cf. Ellis, New Astronomy Reviews Volume 46,
Issue 11, October 2002, P. 645). It seems likely then that if inflation has
occurred, the process should be reversible. I.e. when the increasing density in
a collapsing universe or star reaches a certain limit it should go through a
phase transition to a medium with an equation of state of the type $p=\omega
\rho$, where $-1< \omega <-1/3$. If this phase transition is fundamental, i.e.
occurs for all energy densities, a collapse will always reach a minimum radius
and bounce. If the phase transition is symmetric, the result will lead to
oscillating universes. If however the phase transition is associated with an
hysteresis effect, a collapsing star may, succeeding the bounce inflate into a
new universe with a subsequent phase transition becomes dominated by ordinary
relativistic matter. The aim of this note is study the time development of a
model which mimics this process.",{'name': 'Gustaf Rydbeck'},"5 pages, 2 figures. Replaced since the Abstract is updated and

  Cosmic Formation Rate","Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are brief but intense emission of soft $\gamma-$rays,
mostly lasting from a few seconds to a few thousand seconds. For such kind of
high energy transients, their isotropic-equivalent-energy ($E_{\rm iso}$)
function may be more scientifically meaningful when compared with GRB
isotropic-equivalent-luminosity function ($L_{\rm iso}$), as the traditional
luminosity function refers to steady emission much longer than a few thousand
seconds. In this work we for the first time construct the
isotropic-equivalent-energy function for a sample of 95 bursts with measured
redshifts ($z$) and find an excess of high-$z$ GRBs. Assuming that the excess
is caused by a GRB luminosity function evolution in a power-law form, we find a
cosmic evolution of $E_{\rm iso}\propto(1+z)^{1.80^{+0.36}_{-0.63}}$, which is
comparable to that between $L_{\rm iso}$ and $z$, i.e., $L_{\rm
iso}\propto(1+z)^{2.30^{+0.56}_{-0.51}}$ (both $1\sigma$). The
evolution-removed isotropic-equivalent-energy function can be reasonably fitted
by a broken power-law, in which the dim and bright segments are $\psi(E_{\rm
iso})\propto E_{\rm iso}^{-0.27\pm0.01}$ and $\psi(E_{\rm iso})\propto E_{\rm
iso}^{-0.87\pm0.07}$, respectively ($1\sigma$). For the cosmic GRB formation
rate, it increases quickly in the region of $0 \leq z \lesssim 1$, and roughly
keeps constant for $1\lesssim z \lesssim 4$, and finally falls with a power
index of $-3.80\pm2.16$ for $z\gtrsim 4$, in good agreement with the observed
cosmic star formation rate so far.","[{'name': 'Shi-Wei Wu'}, {'name': 'Dong Xu'}, {'name': 'Fu-Wen Zhang'}, {'name': 'Da-Ming Wei'}]","6 pages, 10 figures.

  We explore forward models for the PWFS in the spatial-frequency domain for
they prove quite useful since a) they emanate directly from physical-optics
(Fourier) diffraction theory; b) provide a straightforward path to meaningful
error breakdowns, c) allow for reconstruction algorithms with $O (n\,log(n))$

optimisation. All these aspects are dealt with here. We focus on recent
analytical PWFS developments and demonstrate the performance using both
analytic and end-to-end simulations.
  We anchor our estimates with observed on-sky contrast on existing systems and
then show very good agreement between analytical and Monte-Carlo estimates for
the PWFS. For a potential upgrade of existing high-contrast imagers on
10\,m-class telescopes with visible or near-infrared PWFS, we show under median
conditions at Paranal a contrast improvement (limited by chromatic and
scintillation effects) of 2x-5x by replacing the wave-front sensor alone at
large separations close to the AO control radius where aliasing dominates, and
factors in excess of 10x by coupling distributed control with the PWFS over

cluster that include injection of kinetic, thermal, and magnetic energy via a
central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in order to study and evaluate the role
that AGN may play in producing the observed cluster-wide magnetic fields. Using
the MHD solver in FLASH 3.3, we compare several sub-resolution approaches to
the evolution of AGN, specifically focusing on large-scale jet and bubble
models. We examine the effects of magnetized outflows on the accretion history
of the black hole and cluster thermodynamic properties, discuss the ability of
various models to magnetize the cluster medium, and assess the sensitivity of
these models to their underlying subgrid parameters. We find that magnetized
jet-based models suffer a severe reduction in accretion rate compared to
hydrodynamic jets; however, bubble models remain largely unaffected. While both
jets and sporadically-placed bubbles have difficulty reproducing the observed
strength and topology of cluster magnetic fields, models based on
centrally-located bubbles come closest to observations. Finally, whereas jet
models are relatively insensitive to changes in their subgrid parameters, the
accretion rate and average magnetic field produced by the bubbles vary by as
much as an order of magnitude depending on the grid resolution and accretion
strength.","[{'name': 'P. M. Sutter'}, {'name': 'H. -Y. Yang'}, {'name': 'P. M. Ricker'}, {'name': 'G. Foreman'}, {'name': 'D. Pugmire'}]","24 pages, 26 figures, 8 tables. Slight adjustments from referee

studied by computing intensities using a time-dependent modulation model. By
introducing recent theoretical advances in the transport coefficients in the
model, computed intensities are compared with Voyager 1, International
Monitoring Platform (IMP) 8, and Ulysses proton observations in search of
compatibility. The effect of different modulation parameters on computed
intensities is also illustrated. It is shown that this approach produces, on a
global scale, realistic cosmic-ray proton intensities along the Voyager 1

intensities recovers much slower towards solar minimum than observed in the
inner heliosphere. A modified time dependence in the diffusion coefficients is
proposed to improve compatibility with the observations at Earth after ~2004.
This modified time dependence led to an improved compatibility between computed
intensities and the observations along the Voyager 1 trajectory and at Earth

during the present polarity cycle is not determined only by changes in the
drift coefficient and tilt angle of the wavy current sheet, but is also largely
dependent on changes in the diffusion coefficients.","[{'name': 'Rex Manuel'}, {'name': 'Stefan Ferreira'}, {'name': 'Marius Potgieter'}]","28 pages, 14 figures, Accepted for publication in Solar Physics",http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5514v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11207-013-0445-y', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.5514v1']",astro-ph.HE,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.SR', 'physics.space-ph']",10.1007/s11207-013-0445-y,

  solar jet","A variety of periodic phenomena have been observed in conjunction with large
solar jets. We aim to find further evidence for {(quasi-)}periodic behaviour in
solar jets and determine what the periodic behaviour can tell us about the
excitation mechanism and formation process of the large solar jet. Using the
304 {\AA} (He-II), 171 {\AA} (Fe IX), 193 {\AA} (Fe XII/XXIV) and 131 {\AA} (Fe
VIII/XXI) filters on-board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA), we investigate the intensity oscillations associated
with a solar jet. Evidence is provided for multiple magnetic reconnection
events occurring between a pre-twisted, closed field and open field lines.
Components of the jet are seen in multiple SDO/AIA filters covering a wide
range of temperatures, suggesting the jet can be classified as a blowout jet.
Two bright, elongated features are observed to be co-spatial with the large
jet, appearing at the jet's footpoints. Investigation of these features reveal
they are defined by multiple plasma ejections. The ejecta display
(quasi-)periodic behaviour on timescales of 50 s and have rise velocities of
40-150 km\,s$^{-1}$ along the open field lines. Due to the suggestion that the
large jet is reconnection-driven and the observed properties of the ejecta, we

  core at z=2.53","At $z\sim2$, star-formation activity is thought to be high even in
high-density environments such as galaxy clusters and proto-clusters. One of
the critical but outstanding issues is if structural growth of star-forming
galaxies can differ depending on their surrounding environments. In order to
investigate how galaxies grow their structures and what physical processes are
involved in the evolution of galaxies, one requires spatially resolved images
of not only stellar components but also star-forming regions within galaxies.
We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging observations for
star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at $z=2.53$ with IRCS and
AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope. A combination of AO and narrow-band
filters allows us to obtain resolved maps of H$\alpha$-emitting regions with an
angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which corresponds to $\sim1$ kpc at
$z\sim2.5$. Based on stacking analyses, we compare radial profiles of
star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming
region of a sub-sample with $\rm log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim10-11$ is more extended
than the stellar component, indicating the inside-out growth of the structure.
This trend is similar to the one for star-forming galaxies in general fields at
$z=2-2.5$ obtained with the same observational technique. Our results suggest
that the structural evolution of star-forming galaxies at $z=2-2.5$ is mainly
driven by internal secular processes irrespective of surrounding environments.","[{'name': 'Tomoko L.

  Spectropolarimetric Signals During Its 2017 Apparition","Spectropolarimetry is a powerful technique for investigating the physical
properties of gas and solid materials in cometary comae without mutual
contamination, but there have been few spectropolarimetric studies to extract
each component. We attempt to derive the continuum polarization degree of comet
2P/Encke, free from influence of molecular emissions. The target is unique in
that it has an orbit dynamically decoupled from Jupiter like main-belt
asteroids, while ejecting gas and dust like ordinary comets. We observed the
comet using the Higashi-Hiroshima Optical and Near-Infrared Camera attached to
the Cassegrain focus of the 150-cm Kanata telescope on UT 2017 February 21 when
the comet was at the solar phase angle of 75.7 deg. We find that the continuum
polarization degree with respect to the scattering plane is 33.8+/-2.7 % at the
effective wavelength of 0.815 um, which is significantly higher than those of
cometary dust in a high-Pmax group at similar phase angles. Assuming that an
ensemble polarimetric response of 2P/Encke's dust as a function of phase angle
is morphologically similar with those of other comets, its maximum polarization
degree is estimated to > 40 % at the phase angle of ~100 deg. In addition, we
obtain the polarization degrees of the C2 swan bands (0.51-0.56 um), the NH2
alpha bands (0.62-0.69 um) and the CN-red system (0.78-0.94 um) in a range of
3-19 %, which depend on the molecular species and rotational quantum numbers of
each branch. The polarization vector aligns nearly perpendicularly to the
scattering plane with the average of 0.4 deg over a wavelength range of
0.50-0.97 um. From the observational evidence, we conjecture that the large
polarization degree of 2P/Encke would be attributable to a dominance of large
dust particles around the nucleus, which have remained after frequent
perihelion passages near the Sun.","[{'name': 'Y. G. Kwon'}, {'name': 'M. Ishiguro'}, {'name': 'Y. Shinnaka'}, {'name': 'T. Nakaoka'}, {'name': 'D. Kuroda'}, {'name': 'H. Hanayama'}, {'name': 'J.

0.0993 day. The shape has a long axis mode (LAM) of L1:L2:L3 = 1.0:1.0:1.6. The
direction of the total rotational angular momentum is around {\lambda} =

The nutation angle is approximately constant at 65{\deg}. (2)

J0632+057, which were carried out to constrain the interaction between the Be
circumstellar disk and the compact object of unknown nature, and provide for
the first time high-dispersion (R > 50000) optical spectra in the second half
of the orbital cycle, from apastron through periastron. The Halpha, Hbeta, and
Hgamma line profiles are found to exhibit remarkable short-term variability for
~1 month after the apastron (phase 0.6--0.7), whereas they show little
variation near the periastron. These emission lines show ""S-shaped"" variations
with timescale of ~150 days, which is about twice that reported previously. In
contrast to the Balmer lines, no profile variability is seen in any FeII
emission line. We estimate the radii of emitting regions of the Halpha, Hbeta,
Hgamma, and FeII emission lines to be ~30, 11, 7, and 2 stellar radii (R_*),
respectively. The amplitudes of the line profile variations in different lines
indicate that the interaction with the compact object affects the Be disk down
to, at least, the radius of 7 R_* after the apastron. This fact, together with
little profile variability near the periastron, rules out the tidal force as
the major cause of disk variability. Although this leaves the pulsar wind as
the most likely candidate mechanism for disk variations, understanding the
details of the interaction, particularly the mechanism for causing a
large-scale disk disturbance after the apastron, remains an open question.","[{'name': 'Yuki Moritani'}, {'name': 'Atsuo T. Okazaki'}, {'name': 'Alex C.

CO(1--0) by the PAWS project. A large number of molecular clouds were
identified and we search for velocity gradients in two high signal-to-noise
subsamples, containing 682 and 376 clouds. The velocity gradients are found to
be systematically prograde oriented, as was previously found for the rather
flocculent spiral M~33. This strongly supports the idea that the velocity
gradients reflect cloud rotation, rather than more random dynamical forces,
such as turbulence. Not only are the gradients prograde, but their
$\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$
coefficients follow galactic shear in sign, although with a lower amplitude. No
link is found between the orientation of the gradient and the orientation of
the cloud. The values of the cloud angular momenta appear to be an extension of
the values noted for galactic clouds despite the orders of magnitude difference
in cloud mass. Roughly 30\% of the clouds show retrograde velocity gradients.
For a strictly rising rotation curve, as in M~51, gravitational contraction
would be expected to yield strictly prograde rotators within an axisymmetric
potential. In M~51, the fraction of retrograde rotators is found to be higher
in the spiral arms than in the disk as a whole. Along the leading edge of the
spiral arms, a majority of the clouds are retrograde rotators. While this work
should be continued on other nearby galaxies, the M~33 and M~51 studies have
shown that clouds rotate and that they rotate mostly prograde, although the
amplitudes are not such that rotational energy is a significant support
mechanism against gravitation. In this work, we show that retrograde rotation
is linked to the presence of a spiral gravitational potential.","[{'name': 'J. Braine'}, {'name': 'A. Hughes'}, {'name': 'E. Rosolowsky'}, {'name': 'P. Gratier'}, {'name': 'D. Colombo'}, {'name': 'S.

  Orbiting Solar-type Stars and Their Implications for Planet Formation and
  Evolution","Since planet occurrence and primordial atmospheric retention probability
increase with period, the occurrence-weighted median planets discovered by
transit surveys may bear little resemblance to the low-occurrence, short-period
planets sculpted by atmospheric escape ordinarily used to calibrate
mass--radius relations and planet formation models. An occurrence-weighted
mass--radius relation for the low-mass planets discovered so far by transit
surveys orbiting solar-type stars requires both occurrence-weighted median
Earth-mass and Neptune-mass planets to have a few percent of their masses in
hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmospheres. Unlike the Earth that finished forming long
after the protosolar nebula was dissipated, these occurrence-weighted median
Earth-mass planets must have formed early in their systems' histories. The
existence of significant H/He atmospheres around Earth-mass planets confirms an
important prediction of the core-accretion model of planet formation. It also
implies core masses $M_{\text{c}}$ in the range $2~M_{\oplus}\lesssim
M_{\text{c}}\lesssim 8~M_{\oplus}$ that can retain their primordial
atmospheres. If atmospheric escape is driven by photoevaporation due to extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) flux, then our observation requires a reduction in the
fraction of incident EUV flux converted into work usually assumed in
photoevaporation models. If atmospheric escape is core driven, then the
occurrence-weighted median Earth-mass planets must have large Bond albedos. In
contrast to Uranus and Neptune that have at least 10% of their masses in H/He
atmospheres, these occurrence-weighted median Neptune-mass planets are H/He
poor. The implication is that they experienced collisions or formed in much
shorter-lived and/or hotter parts of their parent protoplanetary disks than
Uranus and Neptune's formation location in the protosolar nebula.","[{'name': 'Kevin C. Schlaufman'}, {'name': 'Noah D. Halpern'}]","23 pages, 7 figures, and 1 table in aastex631 format; accepted for

  Gaia","Context. Astrometric gravitational microlensing can be used to determine the
mass of a single star (the lens) with an accuracy of a few percent. To do so,
precise measurements of the angular separations between lens and background
star with an accuracy below 1 milli-arcsecond at different epochs are needed.
Hence only the most accurate instruments can be used. However, since the
timescale is in the order of months to years, the astrometric deflection might
be detected by Gaia, even though each star is only observed on a low cadence.
Aims. We want to show how accurately Gaia can determine the mass of the lensing
star. Methods. Using conservative assumptions based on the results of the
second Gaia Data release, we simulated the individual Gaia measurements for 501
predicted astrometric microlensing events during the Gaia era (2014.5 -
2026.5). For this purpose we use the astrometric parameters of Gaia DR2, as
well as an approximative mass based on the absolute G magnitude. By fitting the
motion of lens and source simultaneously we then reconstruct the 11 parameters
of the lensing event. For lenses passing by multiple background sources, we
also fit the motion of all background sources and the lens simultaneously.
Using a Monte-Carlo simulation we determine the achievable precision of the
mass determination. Results. We find that Gaia can detect the astrometric
deflection for 114 events. Further, for 13 events Gaia can determine the mass
of the lens with a precision better than 15% and for 13 + 21 = 34 events with a
precision of 30% or better.","[{'name': 'J. Klüter'}, {'name': 'U. Bastian'}, {'name': 'J. Wambsganss'}]","13 pages; 10 figures; 3 tables; accepted by A&A (April. 28th 2020)

  radio sources in M8","We analyze high-resolution Very Large Array and Jansky Very Large Array
continuum observations of the M8 region carried out at several epochs that span
a period of 30 yr. Our maps reveal two compact sources. One is associated with
Her 36 SE, a possible companion of the O7 luminous massive star Her 36, and the
other is associated to G5.97-1.17, whose proplyd nature was previously
established. With the analyzed data, we do not find significant time
variability in any of these sources. The derived spectral index of $\ge 0.1$
for Her~36 SE, the marginal offset of the radio emission with the previous IR
detection and the associated X-ray emission previously reported suggest the
presence of an unresolved interaction region between the strong winds of Her~36
and Her~36 SE. This region would produce non-thermal contamination to the
global wind emission of Her~36 flattening its spectral index. On the other
hand, the emission of G5.97-1.17 can be also explained by a mixture of thermal
and non-thermal emission components, with different relative contribution of
both emission mechanisms along the proplyd. We argue that the shock created by
the photo-evaporation flow of the proplyd with the collimated stellar wind of
Her~36 accelerates charged particles in G5.97-1.17 producing considerable
synchrotron emission. On the contrary, an electron density enhancement at the
southwest of G5.97-1.17 makes the thermal emission dominant over this region.","[{'name': 'Josep Maria Masqué'}, {'name': 'Sergio Dzib'}, {'name': 'Luís Felipe Rodríguez'}]","19 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ",http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4151v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/797/1/60', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4151v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.1088/0004-637X/797/1/60,

  two-layer planet","Tidal dissipation, which is directly linked to internal structure, is one of
the key physical mechanisms that drive systems evolution and govern their
architecture. A robust evaluation of its amplitude is thus needed to predict
evolution time for spins and orbits and their final states. The purpose of this
paper is to refine recent model of the anelastic tidal dissipation in the
central dense region of giant planets, commonly assumed to retain a large
amount of heavy elements, which constitute an important source of dissipation.
The previous paper evaluated the impact of the presence of the static fluid
envelope on the tidal deformation of the core and on the associated anelastic
tidal dissipation, through the tidal quality factor Qc. We examine here its
impact on the corresponding effective anelastic tidal dissipation, through the
effective tidal quality factor Qp. We show that the strength of this mechanism
mainly depends on mass concentration. In the case of Jupiter- and Saturn-like
planets, it can increase their effective tidal dissipation by, around, a factor
2.4 and 2 respectively. In particular, the range of the rheologies compatible
with the observations is enlarged compared to the results issued from previous
formulations. We derive here an improved expression of the tidal effective
factor Qp in terms of the tidal dissipation factor of the core Qc, without
assuming the commonly used assumptions. When applied to giant planets, the
formulation obtained here allows a better match between the an elastic core's
tidal dissipation of a two-layer model and the observations.","[{'name': 'F. Remus'}, {'name': 'S. Mathis'}, {'name': 'J. -P. Zahn'}, {'name': 'V. Lainey'}]","5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for publication in Astronomy &

close that they will be engulfed when their host stars ascend the giant branch.
This Letter compares the power generated by orbital decay of an engulfed planet
to the intrinsic stellar luminosity. Orbital decay power is generated by drag
on the engulfed companion by the surrounding envelope. As stars ascend the
giant branch their envelope density drops and so does the power injected
through orbital decay, scaling approximately as $L_{\rm decay} \propto
R_*^{-9/2}$. Their luminosity, however, increases along the giant branch. These
opposed scalings indicate a crossing, where $L_{\rm decay}= L_*$. We consider
the engulfment of planets along isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R)
diagram. We find that the conditions for such a crossing occur around
$L_*\approx 10^2$~$L_\odot$ (or $a\approx 0.1$~au) for Jovian planetary
companions. The consumption of closer-in giant planets, such as hot Jupiters,
leads to $L_{\rm decay}\gg L_*$, while more distant planets such as warm
Jupiters, $a\approx 0.5$~au, lead to minor perturbations of their host stars
with $L_{\rm decay} \ll L_*$. Our results map out the parameter space along the
giant branch in the H-R Diagram where interaction with planetary companions
leads to significant energetic disturbance of host stars.","[{'name': 'Morgan MacLeod'}, {'name': 'Matteo Cantiello'}, {'name': 'Melinda Soares-Furtado'}]","7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL",http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04274v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aaa5fa', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04274v1']",astro-ph.SR,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.EP']",10.3847/2041-8213/aaa5fa,

  Binaries","Eccentricity has emerged as a potentially useful tool for helping to identify
the origin of black hole mergers. However, owing to the large number of
harmonics required to compute the amplitude of an eccentric signal, eccentric
templates can be computationally very expensive, making statistical analyses to
distinguish distributions from different formation channels very challenging.
In this paper, we outline a method for estimating the signal-to-noise ratio for
inspiraling binaries at lower frequencies such as those proposed for LISA and
DECIGO. Our approximation can be useful more generally for any quasi-periodic
sources. We argue that surprisingly, the signal-to-noise ratio evaluated at or
near the peak frequency (of the power) is well approximated by using a constant
noise curve, even if in reality the noise strain has power law dependence. We
furthermore improve this initial estimate over our previous calculation to
allow for frequency-dependence in the noise to expand the range of eccentricity
and frequency over which our approximation applies. We show how to apply this
method to get an answer accurate to within a factor of two over almost the
entire projected observable frequency range. We emphasize this method is not a
replacement for detailed signal processing. The utility lies chiefly in
identifying theoretically useful discriminators among different populations and
providing fairly accurate estimates for how well they should work. This
approximation can furthermore be useful for narrowing down parameter ranges in
a computationally economical way when events are observed. We furthermore show
a distinctive way to identify events with extremely high eccentricity where the
signal is enhanced relative to na\""ive expectations on the high frequency end.","[{'name': 'Lisa Randall'}, {'name': 'Alexandra Shelest'}, {'name': 'Zhong-Zhi Xianyu'}]",17 pages,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16030v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac36c5', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16030v1']",astro-ph.HE,"['astro-ph.HE', 'gr-qc', 'hep-ph']",10.3847/1538-4357/ac36c5,

  X-1 observed with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton and Suzaku","We present results from the coordinated broadband X-ray observations of the
extreme ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1 performed by NuSTAR,
XMM-Newton and Suzaku in late 2012. These observations provide the first
high-quality spectra of Holmberg IX X-1 above 10 keV to date, extending the
X-ray coverage of this remarkable source up to ~30 keV. Broadband observations
were undertaken at two epochs, between which Holmberg IX X-1 exhibited both
flux and strong spectral variability, increasing in luminosity from Lx =
(1.90+/-0.03)e40 erg/s to Lx = (3.35+/-0.03)e40 erg/s. Neither epoch exhibits a
spectrum consistent with emission from the standard low/hard accretion state
seen in Galactic black hole binaries, that would have been expected if Holmberg
IX X-1 harbors a truly massive black hole accreting at substantially
sub-Eddington accretion rates. The NuSTAR data confirm that the curvature
observed previously in the 3-10 keV bandpass does represent a true spectral
cutoff. During each epoch, the spectrum appears to be dominated by two
optically thick thermal components, likely associated with an accretion disk.
The spectrum also shows some evidence for a non-thermal tail at the highest
energies, which may further support this scenario. The available data allow for
either of the two thermal components to dominate the spectral evolution,
although both scenarios require highly non-standard behavior for thermal
accretion disk emission.","[{'name': 'D. J. Walton'}, {'name': 'F. A. Harrison'}, {'name': 'B. W. Grefenstette'}, {'name': 'J. M. Miller'}, {'name': 'M. Bachetti'}, {'name': 'D.

Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. It will reach unprecedented
sensitivity and energy resolution in very-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. CTA
will detect Cherenkov light emitted within an atmospheric shower of particles
initiated by cosmic-gamma rays or cosmic rays entering the Earth's atmosphere.
From the combination of images the Cherenkov light produces in the telescopes,
one is able to infer the primary particle energy and direction. A correct
energy estimation can be thus performed only if the local atmosphere is well
characterized. The atmosphere not only affects the shower development itself,
but also the Cherenkov photon transmission from the emission point in the
particle shower, at about 10-20 km above the ground, to the detector. Cherenkov
light on the ground is peaked in the UV-blue region, and therefore molecular
and aerosol extinction phenomena are important. The goal of CTA is to control
systematics in energy reconstruction to better than 10%. For this reason, a
careful and continuous monitoring and characterization of the atmosphere is
required. In addition, CTA will be operated as an observatory, with data made
public along with appropriate analysis tools. High-level data quality can only
be ensured if the atmospheric properties are consistently and continuously
taken into account. In this contribution, we concentrate on discussing the

the degree of polarization (changed by about 2 to 9%) and position angle
(changed by 2 to 22$^\circ$) during the five nights of observations. The
intra-night activity shown by the source appears to be related to turbulence in
the relativistic jet. Sudden change in the PA accompanied by a rise in the DP
could be indicative of the fresh injection of electrons in the jet. The

those from BAHAMAS. We conclude by considering a specific observable, the

star formation models. Multiplicity surveys over the past decade have shown
that binary properties vary strongly with mass, but the functional forms and

unconstrained. We present the results of a large-scale survey of multiplicity
at the bottom of the IMF in several nearby young associations, encompassing 78
very low mass members observed with Keck laser guide star adaptive optics. Our
survey confirms the overall trend observed in the field for lower-mass binary
systems to be less frequent and more compact, including a null detection for
any substellar binary systems with separations wider than ~7 AU. Combined with
a Bayesian re-analysis of existing surveys, our results demonstrate that the
binary frequency and binary separations decline smoothly between masses of 0.5
Msun and 0.02 Msun, though we can not distinguish the functional form of this
decline due to a degeneracy between the total binary frequency and the mean
binary separation. We also show that the mass ratio distribution becomes
progressively more concentrated at q~1 for declining masses, though a small
number of systems appear to have unusually wide separations and low mass ratios
for their mass. Finally, we compare our results to synthetic binary populations

stars in the Kepler field consists of 2 distinct peaks. Second, curiously, for
stars with spectral types G or later the mean FUV-NUV color becomes much bluer,
contrary to expectation. we have found in two samples of mid-F through K type
stars that ~14-18% of them exhibit FUV-excesses relative to their NUV fluxes
and spectral types. Nearly the same fractions are also discovered among members
of the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog and in the published list of Kepler
Objects of Interest. These UV-excess (""UVe"") colors are confirmed by the UV
continuum slopes in GALEX spectra. The SDSS spectra of some UVe stars exhibit
metallic line weakening especially in the blue. This suggests an enhanced
contribution of UV flux relative to photospheric flux of a solar-type single
star. We consider the possibility that the UV excesses originate from various
types of hot stars, including binaries, and strong chromosphere stars that. Our
model atmosphere-derived simulations of colors for binaries with main sequence
pairs with a hot secondary demonstrate that the color loci conflict with the
observed sequence. We are left with the active chromospheres explanation,
whether in active binaries or young stars, as a still tentative explanation for
the UVe stars. We also address the presence of an island of ""UV red"" stars in
the NUV-g, g-i color diagram. The subpopulation comprising this island are
mainly horizontal branch stars. These objects do not exhibit UV excesses and
therefore have UV colors typical for their spectral types. This subpopulation

  Sagittarius Stream as Seen by APOGEE","Using 3D positions and kinematics of stars relative to the Sagittarius (Sgr)
orbital plane and angular momentum, we identify 166 Sgr stream members observed
by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) that
also have Gaia DR2 astrometry. This sample of 63/103 stars in the Sgr
trailing/leading arm are combined with an APOGEE sample of 710 members of the
Sgr dwarf spheroidal core (385 of them newly presented here) to establish
differences of 0.6 dex in median metallicity and 0.1 dex in [$\alpha$/Fe]
between our Sgr core and dynamically older stream samples. Mild chemical
gradients are found internally along each arm, but these steepen when anchored
by core stars. With a model of Sgr tidal disruption providing estimated
dynamical ages (i.e., stripping times) for each stream star, we find a mean
metallicity gradient of 0.12 +/- 0.03 dex/Gyr for stars stripped from Sgr over
time. For the first time, an [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient is also measured within the
stream, at 0.02 +/- 0.01 dex/Gyr using magnesium abundances and 0.04 +/- 0.01
dex/Gyr using silicon, which imply that the Sgr progenitor had significant
radial abundance gradients. We discuss the magnitude of those inferred
gradients and their implication for the nature of the Sgr progenitor within the
context of the current family of Milky Way satellite galaxies, and suggest that
more sophisticated Sgr models are needed to properly interpret the growing
chemodynamical detail we have on the Sgr system.","[{'name': 'Christian R. Hayes'}, {'name': 'Steven R.

  sequence","The bar pattern speed ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) is defined as the rotational
frequency of the bar, and it determines the bar dynamics. Several methods have
been proposed for measuring $\Omega_{\rm b}$. The non-parametric method
proposed by Tremaine \& Weinberg (1984; TW) and based on stellar kinematics is
the most accurate. This method has been applied so far to 17 galaxies, most of
them SB0 and SBa types. We have applied the TW method to a new sample of 15
strong and bright barred galaxies, spanning a wide range of morphological types
from SB0 to SBbc. Combining our analysis with previous studies, we investigate
32 barred galaxies with their pattern speed measured by the TW method. The
resulting total sample of barred galaxies allows us to study the dependence of
$\Omega_{\rm b}$ on galaxy properties, such as the Hubble type. We measured
$\Omega_{\rm b}$ using the TW method on the stellar velocity maps provided by
the integral-field spectroscopy data from the CALIFA survey. Integral-field
data solve the problems that long-slit data present when applying the TW
method, resulting in the determination of more accurate $\Omega_{\rm b}$. In
addition, we have also derived the ratio $\cal{R}$ of the corotation radius to
the bar length of the galaxies. According to this parameter, bars can be
classified as fast ($\cal{R}$ $< 1.4$) and slow ($\cal{R}$>1.4). For all the
galaxies, $\cal{R}$ is compatible within the errors with fast bars. We cannot
rule out (at 95$\%$ level) the fast bar solution for any galaxy. We have not
observed any significant trend between $\cal{R}$ and the galaxy morphological
type. Our results indicate that independent of the Hubble type, bars have been
formed and then evolve as fast rotators. This observational result will
constrain the scenarios of formation and evolution of bars proposed by
numerical simulations.","[{'name': 'J. A. L. Aguerri'}, {'name': 'J. Méndez-Abreu'}, {'name': 'J. Falcón-Barroso'}, {'name': 'A. Amorin'}, {'name': 'J. Barrera-Ballesteros'}, {'name': 'R.

substructures. This analysis is carried out using radial velocities for 269
GCs, obtained with the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II telescope as part of
the SAGES Legacy Unifying Globulars and Galaxies Survey (SLUGGS). We find that
each of the three (formerly identified) GC colour subpopulations reveal
distinct rotation properties. The rotation of the green GC subpopulation is
consistent with the bulk of NGC 4365's stellar light, which `rolls' about the
photometric major axis. The blue and red GC subpopulations show `normal'
rotation about the minor axis. We also find that the red GC subpopulation is
rotationally dominated beyond 2.5 arcmin (~17 kpc) and that the root mean
squared velocity of the green subpopulation declines sharply with radius
suggesting a possible bias towards radial orbits relative to the other GC
subpopulations. Additionally, we find a population of low velocity GCs that
form a linear structure running from the SW to the NE across NGC 4365 which
aligns with the recently reported stellar stream towards NGC 4342. These low
velocity GCs have g'-i' colours consistent with the overall NGC 4365 GC system
but have velocities consistent with the systemic velocity of NGC 4342. We
discuss the possible formation scenarios for the three GC subpopulations as
well as the possible origin of the low velocity GC population.","[{'name': 'Christina Blom'}, {'name': 'Duncan A. Forbes'}, {'name': 'Jean P. Brodie'}, {'name': 'Caroline Foster'}, {'name': 'Aaron J.

The pre-outburst source exhibited a significant near-infrared excess consistent
with a 120 AU shell with 4x10-6 Msun of dust. We infer that the source was
enshrouded by an optically-thick and compact shell of circumstellar material
from an LBV wind, which formed a pseudo-photosphere consistent with S Dor-like
variables in their ""maximum"" phase. Within a year of outburst, the source was
highly variable on 10-30 day timescales. The outburst light curve closely
matches that of the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip, although the observed
velocities are significantly slower than in that event. In Halpha, the outburst
had an excess of blueshifted emission at late times centred around -1500 km/s,
similar to that of double-peaked Type IIn supernovae and the LBV outburst SN

structural parameters and internal dynamical evolution of star clusters in the
Milky Way and in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), caused by the different
gravitational field strengths that they experience. We report here some hints
for such a differential tidal effects in structural parameters of star clusters
in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which is nearly 10 times less massive than
the LMC. A key contribution to this study is the consideration of the SMC as a
triaxial spheroid, from which we estimate the deprojected distances to the SMC
center of the statistically significant sample of star clusters analyzed. By
adopting a 3D geometry of the SMC, we avoid the spurious effects caused by
considering that a star cluster observed along the line-of-sight is close to
the galaxy center. When inspecting the relationships between the star cluster
sizes (represented by the 90% light radii), their eccentricities, masses and
ages with the deprojected distances, we find: (i) the star cluster sizes are
not visibly affected by tidal effects, because relatively small and large
objects are spread through the SMC body. (ii) Star clusters with large
eccentricities (> 0.4) are preferentially found located at deprojected
distances smaller than $\sim$ 7-8 kpc, although many star clusters with smaller
eccentricities are also found occupying a similar volume. (iii) Star clusters
more massive than log(M /Mo) $\sim$ 4.0 are among the oldest star clusters,
generally placed in the outermost SMC region and with a relative small level of
flattening. These findings contrast with the more elongated, generally younger,
less massive and innermost star clusters.",{'name': 'Andrés E. Piatti'},"6 pages, 6 figures. Accepted por publication in Astronomy &

due to the absorption by water and oxygen, the terrestrial atmosphere is
completely opaque at frequencies around 487 and 557 GHz. To cover these
frequencies we used the Odin satellite to perform a spectral line survey in the
frequency ranges 486-492 GHz and 541-577 GHz, filling the gaps between previous
spectral scans. Odin's high main beam efficiency and observations performed
outside the atmosphere make our intensity scale very well determined. We
observed 280 spectral lines from 38 molecules including isotopologues, and, in
addition, 64 unidentified lines. The beam-averaged emission is dominated by CO,
H2O, SO2, SO, 13CO and CH3OH. Species with the largest number of lines are

  Active Galactic Nuclei Detection","Modern sky surveys are producing ever larger amounts of observational data,
which makes the application of classical approaches for the classification and
analysis of objects challenging and time-consuming. However, this issue may be
significantly mitigated by the application of automatic machine and deep
learning methods. We propose ULISSE, a new deep learning tool that, starting
from a single prototype object, is capable of identifying objects sharing the
same morphological and photometric properties, and hence of creating a list of
candidate sosia. In this work, we focus on applying our method to the detection
of AGN candidates in a Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample, since the
identification and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the
optical band still remains a challenging task in extragalactic astronomy.
Intended for the initial exploration of large sky surveys, ULISSE directly uses
features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform a similarity search.
The method is capable of rapidly identifying a list of candidates, starting
from only a single image of a given prototype, without the need for any
time-consuming neural network training. Our experiments show ULISSE is able to
identify AGN candidates based on a combination of host galaxy morphology, color
and the presence of a central nuclear source, with a retrieval efficiency
ranging from 21% to 65% (including composite sources) depending on the
prototype, where the random guess baseline is 12%. We find ULISSE to be most
effective in retrieving AGN in early-type host galaxies, as opposed to
prototypes with spiral- or late-type properties. Based on the results described
in this work, ULISSE can be a promising tool for selecting different types of
astrophysical objects in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g. Euclid,
LSST etc.) that target millions of sources every single night.","[{'name': 'Lars Doorenbos'}, {'name': 'Olena Torbaniuk'}, {'name': 'Stefano Cavuoti'}, {'name': 'Maurizio Paolillo'}, {'name': 'Giuseppe Longo'}, {'name': 'Massimo Brescia'}, {'name': 'Raphael Sznitman'}, {'name': 'Pablo Márquez-Neila'}]",Accepted for publication in A&A,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10984v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202243900', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10984v1']",astro-ph.IM,"['astro-ph.IM', 'cs.CV']",10.1051/0004-6361/202243900,"A&A 666, A171 (2022)"

  Almost all astronomical data ends up in open archives, and access to these is
being simplified by the development of the global Virtual Observatory (VO).
This is a great advance, but the fundamental problem remains that these
archives contain only basic observational data, whereas all the astrophysical
interpretation of that data -- which source is a quasar, which a low-mass star,
and which an image artefact -- is contained in journal papers, with very little
linkage back from the literature to the original data archives. It is therefore
currently impossible for an astronomer to pose a query like ""give me all
sources in this data archive that have been identified as quasars"" and this
limits the effective exploitation of these archives, as the user of an archive
has no direct means of taking advantage of the knowledge derived by its
previous users.
  The AstroDAbis service aims to address this, in a prototype service enabling
astronomers to record annotations and cross-identifications in the AstroDAbis
service, annotating objects in other catalogues. We have deployed two
interfaces to the annotations, namely one astronomy-specific one using the TAP

as the orbital period of a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) residing in a
single circumbinary accretion disk. The proposed orbital separation was around
0.006 pc, and the possible inspiral time about 7 yr in the rest frame of the
quasar. Such objects would be of high interest as the difficult-to-find end
products of binary SMBH evolution, and potential sources of low-frequency
gravitational waves. However, extending the time baseline of the variability
study, Liu et al. (2016) later found that the periodicity of PSO
J334.2028+1.4075 does not remain persistent. Foord et al. (2017) did not find

G352.7-0.1, to understand the causes of such morphology. The research was
carried out based on new and reprocessed archival VLA observations and
XMM-Newton archival data. The surrounding was investigated based on data
extracted from the HI Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, the 13^CO Galactic Ring
Survey and the HI Southern Galactic Plane Survey. The present study revealed
that the overall morphology of both SNRs is the result of the mass-loss history
of their respective progenitor stars. Kes79 would be the product of the
gravitational collapse of a massive O9 star evolving near a molecular cloud and
within the precursor's wind-driven bubble, while G352.7-0.1 would be the result
of interactions of the SNR with an asymmetric wind from the progenitor together
with projection effects. No radio point source or pulsar wind nebula was found
associated with the X-ray pulsar CXOU J185238.6+004020 in Kes79. The X-ray
study of G352.7-0.1, on its hand, revealed that most of the thermal X-ray
radiation completely fills in the interior of the remnant and originates in
heated ejecta. Characteristic parameters, like radio flux, radio spectral
index, age, distance, shock velocity, initial energy and luminosity, were
estimated for both SNRs.","[{'name': 'E. Giacani'}, {'name': 'M. J. S. Smith'}, {'name': 'G. Dubner'}, {'name': 'N. Loiseau'}, {'name': 'G. Castelletti'}, {'name': 'S. Paron'}]","14 pages, 13 figures. Accepted to be published in Astronomy and

  Supercritical Accretion","Supercritical accretion onto compact objects powers a massive wind that is
optically thick and Eddington-limited. If most of the hard X-rays from the
central disk are obscured by the wind, the source will display a blackbody-like
spectrum with a luminosity scaled with the mass of the compact object. From the
Chandra archive of nearby galaxies, we selected a sample of luminous and very
soft sources and excluded contaminations from foreground objects and supernova
remnants. They are found to be preferentially associated with late-type
galaxies. The majority of sources in our sample are either too hot or too
luminous to be explained by nuclear burning on the surface of white dwarfs, and
are argued to be powered by accretion. The most likely explanation is that they
are due to emission from the photosphere of a wind driven by supercritical
accretion onto compact objects. Their blackbody luminosity ranges from ~10^37
to nearly 10^40 erg/s, indicative of the presence of both neutron stars and
stellar-mass black holes. The blackbody luminosity also shows a possible
bimodal distribution, albeit at low significance, peaked around the Eddington
limit for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, respectively. If this can
be confirmed, it will be smoking gun evidence that supercritical accretion
powers thick winds. Based on a wind model, the inferred mass accretion rate of
these objects is around a few hundred times the Eddington rate, suggesting that
they may be intermediate between the canonical ultraluminous X-ray sources and
SS 433 in terms of the accretion rate.","[{'name': 'Yu Zhou'}, {'name': 'Hua Feng'}, {'name': 'Luis C.

  of spectral and variability characteristics","We present the results of a comprehensive investigation on the evolution of
spectral and timing properties of the Galactic black hole candidate 4U 1630--47
during its spectral transitions. In particular, we show how a scaling of the
correlation of the photon index of the Comptonized spectral component Gamma
with low frequency of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO), nu_L and mass
accretion rate, $\dot M$ can be applied to the black hole mass and the
inclination angle estimates. We analyze the transition episodes observed with
the {\it Rossi} X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and BeppoSAX satellites. We find
that the broadband X-ray energy spectra of 4U~1630--47 during all spectral
states can be modeled by a combination of a thermal component, a Comptonized
component and a red-skewed iron line component. We also establish that Gamma
monotonically increases during transition from the low-hard state to the
high-soft state and then saturates for high mass accretion rates. The index
saturation levels vary for different transition episodes. Correlations of Gamma
versus nu_L also shows saturation at Gamma ~ 3. Gamma-Mdot and Gamma-nu_L
correlations with their index saturation revealed in 4U~1630--47 are similar to
those established in a number of other BHCs and can be considered as an
observational evidence for the presence of a black hole in these sources. The
scaling technique, which relies on XTE J1550--564, GRO 1655-40 and H 1743-322
as reference sources, allows us to evaluate a black hole mass in 4U~1630--47

constraining both their interior rotation profile and their convective core
overshoot. In particular, a recent study focusing on theta$ Oph has shown that
a convective core overshoot parameter of alpha = 0.44 is required to model the
observed pulsation frequencies, significantly higher than for other stars of
this type. We investigate the effects of rotation and overshoot in early type
main sequence pulsators, and attempt to use the low order pulsation frequencies
to constrain these parameters. This will be applied to a few test models and
theta Oph. We use a 2D stellar evolution code and a 2D linear adiabatic
pulsation code to calculate pulsation frequencies for 9.5 Msun models. We
calculate low order p-modes for models with a range of rotation rates and
convective core overshoot parameters. Using these models, we find that the
convective core overshoot has a larger effect on the pulsation frequencies than
the rotation, except in the most rapidly rotating models considered. When the
differences in radii are accounted for by scaling the frequencies, the effects
of rotation diminish, but are not entirely accounted for. We find that
increasing the convective core overshoot decreases the large separation, while
producing a slight increase in the small separations. We created a model
frequency grid which spanned several rotation rates and convective core
overshoot values. Using a modified chi^2 statistic, we are able to recover the
rotation velocity and core overshoot for a few test models. Finally, we discuss
the case of the beta Cephei star theta Oph. Using the observed frequencies and
a fixed mass and metallicity, we find a lower overshoot than previously
determined, with alpha = 0.28 +/- 0.05. Our determination of the rotation rate
agrees well with both previous work and observations, around 30 km/s.","[{'name': 'C. C. Lovekin'}, {'name': 'M. -J. Goupil'}]","10 pages, 14 figures.

SDGs) at z=0.03-0.11 in the Padova-Millennium Galaxy and Group Catalogue, a
spectroscopically complete sample representative of the local Universe general
field population. We find that compact galaxies with radii and mass densities
comparable to high-z massive and passive galaxies represent 4.4% of all
galaxies with stellar masses above 3 X 10^10 M_sun, yielding a number density
of 4.3 X 10^-4 h^3 Mpc^-3. Most of them are S0s (70%) or ellipticals (23%), are
red and have intermediate-to-old stellar populations, with a median
luminosity-weighted age of 5.4 Gyr and a median mass-weighted age of 9.2 Gyr.
Their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses are consistent with the small
radii and high stellar mass estimates. Comparing with the WINGS sample of
cluster galaxies at similar redshifts, the fraction of superdense galaxies is
three times smaller in the field than in clusters, and cluster SDGs are on
average 4 Gyr older than field SDGs. We confirm the existence of a universal
trend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass.
On top of the well known dependence of stellar age on galaxy mass, the
luminosity-weighted age of galaxies depends on galaxy compactness at fixed
mass, and, for a fixed mass and radius, on environment. This effect needs to be
taken into account in order not to overestimate the evolution of galaxy sizes
from high- to low-z. Our results and hierarchical simulations suggest that a
significant fraction of the massive compact galaxies at high-z have evolved
into compact galaxies in galaxy clusters today. When stellar age and
environmental effects are taken into account, the average amount of size

compute the total dark matter abundance including the contributions from
condensate decay and nonthermal production from the Standard Model sector. We
then use the Planck limit on isocurvature perturbations to derive a novel

In order to reconcile these data with galaxy formation in the context of LCDM,
processes that alter the shape and density structure of the inner halo are
required. We compile observational properties of LSB galaxies to evaluate the
plausibility that a previously higher baryonic mass content and feedback from
star formation can modify the dark matter halos of these galaxies. We also
compare the properties of bulgeless disk galaxies formed in recent simulations
to the LSB galaxy sample. We find that observational constraints on LSB galaxy
star formation histories, structure, and kinematics make it difficult for
baryonic physics to sphericalize and decrease the central density of the dark
matter halos of LSB galaxies.","[{'name': 'Rachel Kuzio de Naray'}, {'name': 'Kristine Spekkens'}]","Accepted for publication in ApJL; 6 pages, 1 figure, 1 table",http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1288v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/741/2/L29', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.1288v1']",astro-ph.CO,['astro-ph.CO'],10.1088/2041-8205/741/2/L29,"2011, ApJ, 741, L29"

  Measurement Noise","Planetary systems with mean-motion resonances (MMRs) hold special value in
terms of their dynamical complexity and their capacity to constrain planet
formation and migration histories. The key towards making these connections,
however, is to have a reliable characterization of the resonant dynamics,
especially the so-called ""libration amplitude"", which qualitatively measures
how deep the system is into the resonance. In this work, we identify an
important complication with the interpretation of libration amplitude estimates
from observational data of resonant systems. Specifically, we show that
measurement noise causes inferences of the libration amplitude to be
systematically biased to larger values, with noisier data yielding a larger
bias. We demonstrated this through multiple approaches, including using
dynamical fits of synthetic radial velocity data to explore how the the
libration amplitude distribution inferred from the posterior parameter
distribution varies with the degree of measurement noise. We find that even
modest levels of noise still result in a slight bias. The origin of the bias
stems from the topology of the resonant phase space and the fact that the
available phase space volume increases non-uniformly with increasing libration
amplitude. We highlight strategies for mitigating the bias through the usage of
particular priors. Our results imply that many known resonant systems are
likely deeper in resonance than previously appreciated.","[{'name': 'David Jensen'}, {'name': 'Sarah C.

theory or property functions describing the theory. Connection to cosmological

parametrization and stability in Horndeski gravity, showing that the results
are highly dependent on the function parametrization. This can cause
misinterpretations of cosmological observations, hiding and even ruling out key
theoretical signatures. We discuss approaches and constraints that can be
placed on the property functions and scalar sound speed to preserve some
observational properties, but find that parametrizations closest to the
observations, e.g. in terms of the gravitational strengths, offer more robust
physical interpretations. In addition we present an example of how future

  lightning signatures throughout the electromagnetic spectrum","Lightning is an important electrical phenomenon, known to exist in several
Solar System planets. It carries information on convection and cloud formation,
and may be important for pre-biotic chemistry. Exoplanets and brown dwarfs have
been shown to host environments appropriate for the initiation of lightning
discharges. In this PhD project, I aim to determine if lightning on exoplanets
and brown dwarfs can be more energetic than it is known from Solar System
planets, what are the most promising signatures to look for, and if these
""exo-lightning"" signatures can be detected from Earth.
  This thesis focuses on three major topics. First I discuss a lightning
climatology study of Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. I apply the obtained
lightning statistics to extrasolar planets in order to give a first estimate on
lightning occurrence on exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Next, I introduce a short
study of potential lightning activity on the exoplanet HAT-P-11b, based on
previous radio observations. Related to this, I discuss a first estimate of
observability of lightning from close brown dwarfs, with the optical Danish
Telescope. The final part of my project focuses on a lightning radio model,
which is applied to study the energy and radio power released from lightning
discharges in hot giant gas planetary and brown dwarf atmospheres. The released
energy determines the observability of signatures, and the effect lightning has
on the local atmosphere of the object.
  This work combines knowledge obtained from planetary and earth sciences and
uses that to learn more about extrasolar systems. My main results show that
lightning on exoplanets may be more energetic than in the Solar System,
supporting the possibility of future observations and detection of lightning
activity on an extrasolar body. My work provides the base for future radio,

binary system as a function of the disc aspect ratio h, viscosity parameter
alpha, disc outer radius R, and binary inclination angle gamma_F. We also aim
to examine the conditions that lead to an inclined disc being disrupted by
strong differential precession. We use a grid-based hydrodynamic code to
perform 3D simulations. This code has a relatively low numerical viscosity
compared with the SPH schemes that have been used previously to study inclined
discs. This allows the influence of viscosity on the disc evolution to be
tightly controlled. We find that for thick discs (h=0.05) with low alpha,
efficient warp communication in the discs allows them to precess as rigid
bodies with very little warping or twisting. Such discs are observed to align
with the binary orbit plane on the viscous evolution time. Thinner discs with
higher viscosity, in which warp communication is less efficient, develop
significant twists before achieving a state of rigid-body precession. Under the
most extreme conditions we consider (h=0.01, alpha=0.005 and alpha=0.1), we
find that discs can become broken or disrupted by strong differential
precession. Discs that become highly twisted are observed to align with the
binary orbit plane on timescales much shorter than the viscous timescale,
possibly on the precession time. We find agreement with previous studies that
show that thick discs with low viscosity experience mild warping and precess
rigidly. We also find that as h is decreased substantially, discs may be
disrupted by strong differential precession, but for disc thicknesses that are
significantly less (h=0.01) than those found in previous studies (h=0.03).","[{'name': 'Moritz Fragner'}, {'name': 'Richard Nelson'}]","A high resolution version of the paper can be downloaded from:

core-collapse supernovae, in the context of the neutrino heating mechanism. We
combine one dimensional simulations of the shock revival process with a
derivation of a quasi-stationary approximation, which is both accurate and
efficient in predicting the flow. In particular, this approach is used to
explore how the evolution of the system depends on the shock radius, $R_S$, and
velocity, $V_S$ (in addition to other global properties of the system). We do
so through a phase space analysis of the shock acceleration, $a_S$, in the
$R_S-V_S$ plane, shown to provide quantitative insights into the initiation of
runaway expansion and its nature. In the particular case of an initially
stationary ($V_S=0,\;a_S=0$) profile, the prospects for an explosion can be
reasonably assessed by the initial signs of the partial derivatives of the
shock acceleration, in analogy to a linear damped/anti-damped oscillator. If
$\partial a_S/\partial R_S<0$ and $\partial a_S/\partial V_S>0$, runaway
expansion will likely occur after several oscillations, while if $\partial
a_S/\partial R_S>0$, runaway expansion will commence in a non-oscillatory
fashion. These two modes of runaway correspond to low and high mass accretion
rates, respectively. We also use the quasi-stationary approximation to assess
the advection-to-heating timescale ratio in the gain region, often used as an
explosion proxy. Indeed, this ratio does tend to $\sim1$ in conjunction with
runaway conditions, but neither this unit value nor the specific choice of the
gain region as a point of reference appear to be distinct conditions in this
regard.","[{'name': 'Daniel Gabay', 'affiliation': 'HUJI'}, {'name': 'Shmuel Balberg', 'affiliation': 'HUJI'}, {'name': 'Uri Keshet', 'affiliation': 'BGU'}]","22 pages, 13 figures, submitted to ApJ.

star-forming galaxies within 20 Mpc using the Very Large Array (VLA) and the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Natal star-forming regions can be
identified by their characteristic thermal radio emission, which is manifest in
their spectral index at centimeter wavelengths. The host galaxies in our sample
were selected based upon their likelihood of harboring young star formation. In
star-forming regions, the ionizing flux of massive embedded stars powers the
dominant thermal free-free emission of those sources, resulting in a spectral
index of {\alpha} {\gtrsim} -0.2 (where S{\nu} {\propto} {\nu}{\alpha}), which
we compute. With the current sensitivity, we find that of the 25 galaxies in
this sample only five have radio sources with spectral indices that are only
consistent with a thermal origin; four have radio sources that are only
consistent with a non-thermal origin; six have radio sources whose nature is
ambiguous due to uncertainties in the spectral index; and sixteen have no
detected radio sources. For those sources that appear to be dominated by
thermal emission, we infer the ionizing flux of the star clusters and the
number of equivalent O7.5 V stars that are required to produce the observed
radio flux densities. The most radio-luminous clusters that we detect have an
equivalent of ~7x103 O7.5 V stars, and the smallest only have an equivalent of

simulations that include an exceptionally close passage of the Sun-like star HD

$M_*$ ($\sim10^{9.5}-10^{11.5}M_\odot$). We find a correlation between
log(SFR(H$\alpha$)) and log($M_*$) with a slope of 0.65$\pm$0.08
(0.58$\pm$0.10) at 1.4<z<2.6 (2.1<z<2.6). We find that different assumptions
for the dust correction, such as using the color-excess of the stellar
continuum to correct the nebular lines, sample selection biases against red
star-forming galaxies, and not accounting for Balmer absorption can yield
steeper slopes of the log(SFR)-log($M_*$) relation. Our sample is immune from
these biases as it is rest-frame optically selected, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ are
corrected for Balmer absorption, and the H$\alpha$ luminosity is dust-corrected
using the nebular color-excess computed from the Balmer decrement. The scatter
of the log(SFR(H$\alpha$))-log($M_*$) relation, after accounting for the
measurement uncertainties, is 0.31 dex at 2.1<z<2.6, which is 0.05 dex larger
than the scatter in log(SFR(UV))-log($M_*$). Based on comparisons to a
simulated SFR-$M_*$ relation with some intrinsic scatter, we argue that in the
absence of direct measurements of galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the
attenuation/extinction curves and the IMF, one cannot use the difference in the
scatter of the SFR(H$\alpha$)- and SFR(UV)-$M_*$ relations to constrain the
stochasticity of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.","[{'name': 'Irene Shivaei'}, {'name': 'Naveen A. Reddy'}, {'name': 'Alice E.

  Formation","Galaxy formation models and simulations rely on various feedback mechanisms
to reproduce the observed baryonic scaling relations and galaxy morphologies.
Although dwarf galaxy and giant elliptical properties can be explained using
feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei, Milky Way-sized galaxies
still represent a challenge to current theories of galaxy formation. In this
paper, we explore the possible role of feedback from stellar radiation in
regulating the main properties of disk galaxies such as our own Milky Way. We
have performed a suite of cosmological simulations of the same $\sim10^{12}
{\rm M}_{\odot}$ halo selected based on its rather typical mass accretion
history. We have implemented radiative feedback from young stars using a crude
model of radiative transfer for ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation.
However, the model is realistic enough such that the dust opacity plays a
direct role in regulating the efficiency of our feedback mechanism. We have
explored various models for the dust opacity, assuming different constant dust
temperatures, as well as a varying dust temperature model. We find that while
strong radiative feedback appears as a viable mechanism to regulate the stellar
mass fraction in massive galaxies, it also prevents the formation of discs with
reasonable morphologies. In models with strong stellar radiation feedback,
stellar discs are systematically too thick while the gas disc morphology is
completely destroyed due to the efficient mixing between the feedback-affected
gas and its surroundings. At the resolution of our simulation suite, we find it
impossible to preserve spiral disc morphology while at the same time expelling
enough baryons to satisfy the abundance matching constraints.","[{'name': 'Rok Roškar'}, {'name': 'Romain Teyssier'}, {'name': 'Oscar Agertz'}, {'name': 'Markus Wetzstein'}, {'name': 'Ben Moore'}]",accepted to MNRAS,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6321v3,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu1548', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6321v3']",astro-ph.CO,['astro-ph.CO'],10.1093/mnras/stu1548,

are investigated, using a sample of late-time nebular spectra. First, a
kinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the
main features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)
late-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain
the observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively
high density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a
relatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically
distributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region
and outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a
delayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the
global asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can
lead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the
direction of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the
emission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For
this model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the
implications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the
central wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some
lines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at
4700A) will not show this effect. By examining optical nebular spectra of 12
SNe Ia, we have found that such a variation indeed exists. We suggest that the
global asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, as likely imprint of the deflagration
flame propagation, is a generic feature of SNe Ia (abridged).","[{'name': 'Keiichi Maeda'}, {'name': 'Stefan Taubenberger'}, {'name': 'Jesper Sollerman'}, {'name': 'Paolo A.

the X-ray emission of PKS 2155$-$304 during different intensity states in
2009$-$2014 using XMM$-$Newton satellite. We studied the spectral curvature of
all of the observations to provide crucial information on the energy
distribution of the non-thermal particles. Most of the observations show
curvature or deviation from a single power-law and can be well modeled by a log
parabola model. In some of the observations, we find spectral flattening after
6 keV. In order to find the possible origin of the X-ray excess, we built the
Multi-band Spectral Energy distribution (SED). We find that the X-ray excess in
PKS 2155--304 is difficult to fit in the one zone model but, could be easily
reconciled in the spine/layer jet structure. The hard X-ray excess can be
explained by the inverse Comptonization of the synchrotron photons (from the

that spectra of half of the QSOs appear redder during their brighter phases.
There is no obvious difference in slope variability between sub-samples of

radio jet does not affect the slope variability on 10-year timescales. The

determine the mass of the planet using radial velocities. We validated
HAT-P-67b via two Doppler tomographic detections of the planetary transit,
which eliminated potential eclipsing binary blend scenarios. The Doppler
tomographic observations also confirmed that HAT-P-67b has an orbit that is
aligned to within 12 degrees, in projection, with the spin of its host star.

angular momenta, reproduces the precession due to general relativity of
particles whose specific orbital energy is small compared to c^2 in the
Schwarzschild metric. For bound orbits the constraint of low energy is
equivalent to requiring the apoapsis of a particle to be large compared to the
Schwarzschild radius. Such low energy orbits are ubiquitous close to
supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, but the potential is relevant in
any context containing particles on low energy orbits. Like the more complex
post-Newtonian expressions, the potential correctly reproduces the precession
in the far-field, but also correctly reproduces the position and magnitude of
the logarithmic divergence in precession for low angular momentum orbits. An
additional advantage lies in its simplicity, both in computation and
implementation. We also provide two simpler, but less accurate potentials, for
cases where orbits always remain at large angular momenta, or when the extra
accuracy is not needed. In all of the presented cases the accuracy in
precession in low energy orbits exceeds that of the well known potential of

the history of metal enrichment and outflows in a suite of twenty
high-resolution simulated galaxies. These simulations agree with the observed
stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation, an agreement that relies on
large fractions of the produced metals escaping into the CGM. For instance, in
galaxies with Mvir ~ 1e9.5 -- 1e10 solar masses, we find that about ~ 85% of
the available metals are outside of the galactic disk at z = 0, although the
fraction decreases to a little less than half in Milky Way-mass galaxies. In
many cases, these metals are spread far beyond the virial radius. We analyze
the metal deficit within the ISM and stars in the context of previous work
tracking the inflow and outflow of baryons. Outflows are prevalent across the
entire mass range, as is reaccretion. We find that between 40 and 80% of all
metals removed from the galactic disk are later reaccreted. The outflows
themselves are metal enriched relative to the ISM by a factor of 0.2 dex
because of the correspondence between sites of metal enrichment and outflows.
As a result, the metal mass loading factor scales as eta_metals \propto
v_circ^-0.91, a somewhat shallower scaling than the total mass loading factor.
We analyze the simulated galaxies within the context of analytic chemical
evolution models by determining their net metal expulsion efficiencies, which
encapsulate the rates of metal loss and reaccretion. We discuss these results
in light of the inflow and outflow properties necessary for reproducing the
mass-metallicity relation.","[{'name': 'Charlotte R.

stringent computational constraints. In particular, incorporating collisional
effects (especially destructive collisions) into an N-body scheme was deemed an
impossible task because of the exponential increase of particles it would
imply.

  to z=2.5","It is widely reported, based on clustering measurements of observed active
galactic nuclei (AGN) samples, that AGN reside in similar mass host dark matter
halos across the bulk of cosmic time, with log $M/M_\odot$~12.5-13.0 to z~2.5.
We show that this is due in part to the AGN fraction in galaxies rising with
increasing stellar mass, combined with AGN observational selection effects that
exacerbate this trend. Here, we use AGN specific accretion rate distribution
functions determined as a function of stellar mass and redshift for
star-forming and quiescent galaxies separately, combined with the latest
galaxy-halo connection models, to determine the parent and sub-halo mass
distribution function of AGN to various observational limits. We find that
while the median (sub-)halo mass of AGN, $\approx10^{12}M_\odot$, is fairly
constant with luminosity, specific accretion rate, and redshift, the full halo
mass distribution function is broad, spanning several orders of magnitude. We
show that widely used methods to infer a typical dark matter halo mass based on
an observed AGN clustering amplitude can result in biased, systematically high
host halo masses. While the AGN satellite fraction rises with increasing parent
halo mass, we find that the central galaxy is often not an AGN. Our results
elucidate the physical causes for the apparent uniformity of AGN host halos
across cosmic time and underscore the importance of accounting for AGN
selection biases when interpreting observational AGN clustering results. We
further show that AGN clustering is most easily interpreted in terms of the
relative bias to galaxy samples, not from absolute bias measurements alone.","[{'name': 'James Aird'}, {'name': 'Alison L. Coil'}]","19 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS. Updated to

  Earth","Earth has had oceans for nearly four billion years and Mars had lakes and
rivers 3.5-3.8 billion years ago. However, it is still unknown whether water
has ever condensed on the surface of Venus because the planet - now completely
dry - has undergone global resurfacing events that obscure most of its history.
The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of
Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only
been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models that cannot account
for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate
stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model
simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds - which preferentially
form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption -
have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even
at modest insolations (down to 325 W/m2, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar
constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans
never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the
formation of Earth's oceans required much lower insolation than today, which
was made possible by the faint young Sun. This also implies the existence of
another stability state for present-day Earth: the 'Steam Earth', with all the
water from the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere.","[{'name': 'Martin Turbet'}, {'name': 'Emeline Bolmont'}, {'name': 'Guillaume Chaverot'}, {'name': 'David Ehrenreich'}, {'name': 'Jeremy Leconte'}, {'name': 'Emmanuel Marcq'}]",Published in Nature (13 October 2021),http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08801v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03873-w', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08801v1']",astro-ph.EP,"['astro-ph.EP', 'physics.ao-ph']",10.1038/s41586-021-03873-w,"Nature 598, 276-280 (2021)"

Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), TOI-1199 b and TOI-1273 b, with
periods of 3.7 and 4.6 days, respectively. Follow-up observations for both
targets, which include several ground-based light curves, confirmed the transit
events. High-precision radial velocities from the SOPHIE spectrograph revealed
signals at the expected frequencies and phases of the transiting candidates and
allowed mass determinations with a precision of $8.4\%$ and $6.7\%$ for
TOI-1199 b and TOI-1273 b, respectively. The planetary and orbital parameters
were derived from a joint analysis of the radial velocities and photometric
data. We find that the planets have masses of
$0.239\,\pm\,0.020\,M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and $0.222\,\pm\,0.015\,M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and
radii of $0.938\,\pm\,0.025\,R_{\mathrm{J}}$ and
$0.99\,\pm\,0.22\,R_{\mathrm{J}}$, respectively. The grazing transit of
TOI-1273 b translates to a larger uncertainty in its radius, and hence also in
its bulk density, compared to TOI-1199 b. The inferred bulk densities of
$0.358\,\pm\,0.041\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and
$0.28\,\pm\,0.11\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ are among the lowest known for
exoplanets in this mass range, which, considering the brightness of the host
stars ($V \approx 11\,\mathrm{mag}$), render them particularly amenable to
atmospheric characterization via the transit spectroscopy technique. The better
constraints on the parameters of TOI-1199 b provide a transmission spectroscopy
metric of $134\,\pm\,17$, making it the better suited of the two planets for

Data reduction employed two different methods of speckle suppression and
spectrum extraction, both yielding results that agree. The spectra do not
directly correspond to those of any known objects, although similarities with L

closely-spaced orbits are common, which motivates the question ""How closely can
planets orbit to one another and still be dynamically-stable for very long
times?"". To address this question, we investigate the stability of idealized
planetary systems consisting of five planets, each equal in mass to the Earth,
orbiting a one solar mass star. All planets orbit in the same plane and in the
same direction, and the planets are uniformly spaced in units of mutual Hill
Sphere radii. Most of the systems that we integrate begin with one or more
planets on eccentric orbits, with eccentricities $e$ as large as $e= 0.05$
being considered. For a given initial orbital separation, larger initial
eccentricity of a single planet generally leads to shorter system lifetime,
with little systematic dependence of which planet is initially on an eccentric
orbit. The approximate trend of instability times increasing exponentially with
initial orbital separation of the planets found previously for planets with
initially circular orbits is also present for systems with initially eccentric
orbits. Mean motion resonances also tend to destabilize these systems, although
the reductions in system lifetimes are not as large as for initially circular
orbits. Systems with all planets having initial $e= 0.05$ and aligned periapse

  Relativistic Extensions","A wealth of astronomical data indicate the presence of mass discrepancies in
the Universe. The motions observed in a variety of classes of extragalactic
systems exceed what can be explained by the mass visible in stars and gas.
Either (i) there is a vast amount of unseen mass in some novel form - dark
matter - or (ii) the data indicate a breakdown of our understanding of dynamics
on the relevant scales, or (iii) both. Here, we first review a few outstanding
challenges for the dark matter interpretation of mass discrepancies in
galaxies, purely based on observations and independently of any alternative
theoretical framework. We then show that many of these puzzling observations
are predicted by one single relation - Milgrom's law - involving an
acceleration constant (or a characteristic surface density) of the order of the
square-root of the cosmological constant in natural units. This relation can at
present most easily be interpreted as the effect of a single universal force
law resulting from a modification of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) on galactic
scales. We exhaustively review the current observational successes and problems
of this alternative paradigm at all astrophysical scales, and summarize the
various theoretical attempts (TeVeS, GEA, BIMOND, and others) made to
effectively embed this modification of Newtonian dynamics within a relativistic
theory of gravity.","[{'name': 'Benoit Famaey'}, {'name': 'Stacy McGaugh'}]","164 pages, 48 figures, 2 tables, invited review for Living Reviews in

stars. Red giants are targets of interest since they present mixed modes, which
behave as pressure modes in the convective envelope and as gravity modes in the
radiative core. Mixed modes thus directly probe red giant cores, and allow in
particular the study of their mean core rotation. The high-quality data
obtained by CoRoT and Kepler satellites represent an unprecedented perspective
to obtain thousands of measurements of red giant core rotation, in order to
improve our understanding of stellar physics in deep stellar interiors. We
developed an automated method to obtain such core rotation measurements and
validated it for stars on the red giant branch. In this work, we particularly
focus on the specific application of this method to red giants having a rapid
core rotation. They show complex spectra where it is tricky to disentangle
rotational splittings from mixed-mode period spacings. We demonstrate that the
method based on the identification of mode crossings is precise and efficient.
The determination of the mean core rotation directly derives from the precise
measurement of the asymptotic period spacing {\Delta}{\Pi}1 and of the
frequency at which the crossing of the rotational components is observed.","[{'name': 'Charlotte Gehan'}, {'name': 'Benoît Mosser'}, {'name': 'Eric Michel'}]","4 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, to be published in the Astro Fluid 2016

of star-forming galaxies, usually redshifted by a few hundreds of km/s compared
to the systemic redshift. This large offset hampers follow-up surveys, galaxy

available. We propose diagnostics that can be used to recover the systemic
redshift directly from the properties of the lya line profile. We use
spectroscopic observations of Lyman-Alpha Emitters (LAEs) for which a precise
measurement of the systemic redshift is available. Our sample contains 13
sources detected between z~3 and z~6 as part of various Multi Unit

include a compilation of spectroscopic lya data from the literature spanning a
wide redshift range (z~0-8). First, restricting our analysis to double-peaked
lya spectra, we find a tight correlation between the velocity offset of the red
peak with respect to the systemic redshift, Vpeak, and the separation of the
peaks. Secondly, we find a correlation between Vpeak and the full width at half
maximum of the lya line. Fitting formulas, to estimate systemic redshifts of

the nearby G dwarfs HD 131664 and HD 43848. We carry out orbital fits to the
Hipparcos IAD for the two stars, taking advantage of the knowledge of the
spectroscopic orbits, and solving for the two orbital elements that can be
determined in principle solely by astrometry, the inclination angle $i$ and the
longitude of the ascending node $\Omega$. A number of checks are carried out in
order to assess the reliability of the orbital solutions thus obtained. The
best-fit solution for HD 131664 yields $i=55\pm33$ deg and $\Omega=22\pm28$
deg. The resulting inferred true companion mass is then $M_c = 23_{-5}^{+26}$
$M_J$. For \object{HD 43848}, we find $i=12\pm7$ deg and $\Omega=288\pm22$ deg,
and $M_c = 120_{-43}^{+167}$ $M_J$. Based on the statistical evidence from an
$F$-test, the study of the joint confidence intervals of variation of $i$ and
$\Omega$, and the comparison of the derived orbital semi-major axes with a
distribution of false astrometric orbits obtained for single stars observed by
Hipparcos, the astrometric signal of the two companions to HD 131664 and HD

statistical confidence not exceeding 95%. We constrain the true mass of HD

degree of confidence ($\sim2-\sigma$). For HD 43848b, a true mass in the brown
dwarf regime is ruled out at the $1-\sigma$ confidence level. [abridged]","[{'name': 'A. Sozzetti', 'affiliation': 'INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino'}, {'name': 'S. Desidera'}]","13 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in Astronomy

suggested by McComas et al. (2009) for the origin of the heliospheric ENA
ribbon -- the most prominent feature seen in the all sky maps of heliospheric
ENAs discovered by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). The ribbon is a
region of enhanced fluxes of ENAs crossing almost the entire sky. Soon after
the ribbon's discovery it was realized (McComas et al., 2009) that the
enhancement of the fluxes could be in the directions where the radial component
of the interstellar magnetic field around the heliopause is close to zero
(Schwadron et al., 2009). Our model includes secondary charge exchange of the
interstellar H atoms with the interstellar pickup protons outside the
heliopause and is a further advancement of the kinetic-gasdynamic model by
Malama et al. (2006) where pickup protons were treated as a separate kinetic
component. Izmodenov et al. (2009) have shown in the frame of Malama's model
that the interstellar pickup protons outside the heliopause maybe a significant
source of ENAs at energies above 1 keV. The difference between the current work
and that of Izmodenov et al. (2009) is in the assumption of no-scattering for
newly created pickup protons outside the heliopause. In this limit the model
produces a feature qualitatively similar to the ribbon observed by IBEX.","[{'name': 'S. V. Chalov'}, {'name': 'D. B. Alexashov'}, {'name': 'D. McComas'}, {'name': 'V. V. Izmodenov'}, {'name': 'Yu.

that affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. We compute the
merger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc <= rp <=
50h^-1 kpc and Dv <= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of the
ALHAMBRA survey. We study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,
that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v as
the intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. We develop a maximum
likelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion due
to the observational errors (including the Poisson shot noise term). The cosmic
variance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of the
populations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)
galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume V_c. We find a
significant dependence on neither the search radius used to define close
companions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellar
mass) of the samples. We provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance with
n_1, n_2, and V_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} V_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.

recent astronomy. During the last decade a consensus formed that long GRBs
(LGRBs) arise from the collapse of massive stars and that short GRBs (SGRBs)
have a different origin, most likely neutron star mergers. A key ingredient of
the Collapsar model that explains how the collapse of massive stars produces a
GRB is the emergence of a relativistic jet that penetrates the stellar
envelope. The condition that the emerging jet penetrates the envelope poses
strong constraints on the system. Using these constraints we show that: (i) Low
luminosity GRBs (llGRBs), a sub population of GRBs with a very low luminosities
(and other peculiar properties: single peaked, smooth and soft) cannot be
formed by Collapsars. llGRBs must have a different origin (most likely a shock
breakout). (ii) On the other hand regular LGRBs must be formed by Collapsars.
(iii) While for BATSE the dividing duration between Collapsars and
non-Collapsar is indeed at $\sim 2$ sec, the dividing duration is different for
other GRBs detectors. In particular most Swift bursts longer than 0.8 sec are
of a Collapsar origin. This last results requires a revision of many
conclusions concerning the origin of Swift SGRBs which were based on the
commonly used 2 sec limit.","[{'name': 'Tsvi Piran'}, {'name': 'Omer Bromberg'}, {'name': 'Ehud Nakar'}, {'name': ""Re'em Sari""}]","Revised version accepted for publication in the Philosophical

two principal characteristics of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. The high
latitude carbon star HE 1015-2050 was identified as a hydrogen-deficient carbon
star from low-resolution spectroscopy. Photometric data of the Catalina
Real-Time Transient Survey gathered between 2006 February and 2012 May indicate
that the object exhibits no variability. However, a high-resolution (R ~
50,000) optical spectrum of this object obtained with the 8.2m Subaru telescope
using High Dispersion Spectrograph on the 2012 January 13 offers sufficient
spectral evidences for the object being a cool HdC star of RCB type undergoing
light decline. In contrast to the Na I D broad absorption features, seen in the
low-resolution spectra on several occasions, the high-resolution spectrum
exhibits Na I D2 and D1 features in emission. A few emission lines due to Mg I,
Sc II, Ti I, Ti II, Fe II and Ba I are also observed in the spectrum of this
object for the first time. Such emission features combined with neutral and
singly ionized lines of Ca, Ti, Fe, etc., in absorption are reportedly seen in
RCBs spectra in the early stage of decline or during the recovery to maximum.
Further, the light decline of RCBs is ascribed to the formation of a cloud of
soot that obscures the visible photosphere. Presence of such circumstellar
material is evident from the polarimetric observations with an estimated V-band
percentage polarization of ~1.7% for this object.","[{'name': 'Aruna Goswami', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India'}, {'name': 'Wako Aoki', 'affiliation': 'National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan'}]","16 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical

correlation between the central surface density and the halo core radius of
galaxy, and cluster of galaxies, dark matter haloes was analyzed, this having
recently been studied on a wide range of scales. We used Del Popolo (2009)
secondary infall model taking into account ordered and random angular momentum,
dynamical friction, and dark matter (DM) adiabatic contraction to calculate the
density profile of haloes, and then these profiles are used to determine the
surface density of DM haloes. The main result is that $r_\ast$ (the halo
characteristic radius) is not an universal quantity as claimed by Donato et al.
(2009) and Gentile et al. (2009). On the contrary, we find a correlation with
the halo mass $M_{200}$ in agreement with Cardone & Tortora (2010), Boyarsky at
al. (2009) and Napolitano et al. (2010), but with a significantly smaller
scatter, namely $0.16 \pm 0.05$. We also consider the baryon column density
finding this latter being indeed a constant for low mass systems such as
dwarfs, but correlating with mass with a slope $\alpha= 0.18 \pm 0.05$. In the
case of the surface density of dark matter for a system composed only of dark

solar-like stars we study the behavior of the hydrodynamic atmospheric escape
of hydrogen for small values of the Jeans escape parameter $\beta < 3$, near
the base of the thermosphere, that is defined as a ratio of the gravitational
and thermal energy. Our study is based on a 1-D hydrodynamic upper atmosphere
model that calculates the volume heating rate in a hydrogen dominated
thermosphere due to the absorption of the stellar soft X-ray and extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) flux. We find that when the $\beta$ value near the
mesopause/homopause level exceeds a critical value of $\sim$2.5, there exists a
steady hydrodynamic solution with a smooth transition from subsonic to
supersonic flow. For a fixed XUV flux, the escape rate of the upper atmosphere
is an increasing function of the temperature at the lower boundary. Our model
results indicate a crucial enhancement of the atmospheric escape rate, when the
Jeans escape parameter $\beta$ decreases to this critical value. When $\beta$
becomes $\leq$2.5, there is no stationary hydrodynamic transition from subsonic
to supersonic flow. This is the case of a fast non-stationary atmospheric
expansion that results in extreme thermal atmospheric escape rates.","[{'name': 'N. V. Erkaev'}, {'name': 'H. Lammer'}, {'name': 'P. Odert'}, {'name': 'Yu. N. Kulikov'}, {'name': 'K. G.

  from Keplerian disc rotation","The gap formation induced by a giant planet is important in the evolution of
the planet and the protoplanetary disc. We examine the gap formation by a
planet with a new formulation of one-dimensional viscous discs which takes into
account the deviation from Keplerian disc rotation due to the steep gradient of
the surface density. This formulation enables us to naturally include the
Rayleigh stable condition for the disc rotation. It is found that the
derivation from Keplerian disc rotation promotes the radial angular momentum
transfer and makes the gap shallower than in the Keplerian case. For deep gaps,
this shallowing effect becomes significant due to the Rayleigh condition. In
our model, we also take into account the propagation of the density waves
excited by the planet, which widens the range of the angular momentum
deposition to the disc. The effect of the wave propagation makes the gap wider
and shallower than the case with instantaneous wave damping. With these
shallowing effects, our one-dimensional gap model is consistent with the recent
hydrodynamic simulations.","[{'name': 'Kazuhiro D.

  calibration errors","Kernel-phase is a data analysis method based on a generalization of the
notion of closure-phase invented in the context of interferometry, but that
applies to well corrected diffraction dominated images produced by an arbitrary
aperture. The linear model upon which it relies theoretically leads to the
formation of observable quantities robust against residual aberrations. In
practice, detection limits reported thus far seem to be dominated by systematic
errors induced by calibration biases not sufficiently filtered out by the
kernel projection operator. This paper focuses on the impact the initial
modeling of the aperture has on these errors and introduces a strategy to
mitigate them, using a more accurate aperture transmission model. The paper
first uses idealized monochromatic simulations of a non trivial aperture to
illustrate the impact modeling choices have on calibration errors. It then
applies the outlined prescription to two distinct data-sets of images whose
analysis has previously been published. The use of a transmission model to
describe the aperture results in a significant improvement over the previous
type of analysis. The thus reprocessed data-sets generally lead to more
accurate results, less affected by systematic errors. As kernel-phase observing
programs are becoming more ambitious, accuracy in the aperture description is
becoming paramount to avoid situations where contrast detection limits are
dominated by systematic errors. Prescriptions outlined in this paper will
benefit any attempt at exploiting kernel-phase for high-contrast detection.","[{'name': 'Frantz Martinache'}, {'name': 'Alban Ceau'}, {'name': 'Romain Laugier'}, {'name': 'Jens Kammerer'}, {'name': ""Mamadou N'Diaye""}, {'name': 'David Mary'}, {'name': 'Nick Cvetojevic'}, {'name': 'Coline Lopez'}]","12 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication by Astronomy &

interferometer working in the millimeter wave band (39.5 GHz - 40 GHz) for
observing solar radio emissions through nulling interference. The system is
composed of two 50 cm aperture Cassegrain antennas mounted on a common
equatorial mount, with a separation of 230 wavelengths. The cross-correlation
of the received signals effectively cancels the quiet solar component of the
large flux density (~3000 sfu) that reduces the detection limit due to
atmospheric fluctuations. The system performance is obtained as follows: the
noise factor of the AFE in the observation band is less than 2.1 dB, system
sensitivity is approximately 12.4 K (~34 sfu) with an integration time constant
of 0.1 ms (default), the frequency resolution is 153 kHz, and the dynamic range
is larger than 30 dB. Through actual testing, the nulling interferometer
observes a quiet sun with a low level of output fluctuations (of up to 50 sfu)
and has a significantly lower radiation flux variability (of up to 190 sfu)
than an equivalent single-antenna system, even under thick cloud cover. As a
result, this new design can effectively improve observation sensitivity by
reducing the impact of atmospheric and system fluctuations during observation.","[{'name': 'Yonglin Yu'}, {'name': 'Shuo Xu'}, {'name': 'Lei Zhang'}, {'name': 'Ziqian Shang'}, {'name': 'Chenglong Qiao'}, {'name': 'Shuqi Li'}, {'name': 'Zhao Wu'}, {'name': 'Yanrui Su'}, {'name': 'Hongqiang Song'}, {'name': 'Yao Chen'}, {'name': 'Fabao Yan'}]",,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17424v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/acd9af', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17424v1']",astro-ph.IM,['astro-ph.IM'],10.3847/1538-4365/acd9af,

literature, and analyzed the correlations among the host galaxy offsets (the
distance from the site of the GRB to the center of its host galaxy), $T_{\rm

that $ T_{\rm 90,i}$, $ T_{\rm R45,i}$, $ E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$, $L_{\rm pk}$
have negative correlation with $ {\rm offset}$, which is consistent with origin
of short GRBs (SGRBs) and long GRBs (LGRBs). On separate analysis, we found
similar results for $\log E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$ - $\log {\rm (offset)}$ and $\log
L_{\rm pk}$ - $\log {\rm (offset)}$ relations in case of SGRBs only, while no
obvious relation for LGRBs. There is no correlations between offset and $L_{\rm

ultra-relativistic jets. It is challenging to study the jet close to the
central source, due to the high opacity of the medium. In this paper, we
present numerical simulations of relativistic jets propagating through a
massive, stripped envelope star associated to long GRBs, breaking out of the
star and accelerating into the circumstellar medium. We compute the
gravitational wave (GW) signal resulting from the propagation of the jet
through the star and the circumstellar medium. We show that key parameters of
the jet propagation can be directly determined by the GW signal. The signal
presents a first peak corresponding to the jet duration and a second peak which
corresponds to the break-out time for an observer located close to the jet axis
(which in turn depends on the stellar size), or to much larger times
(corresponding to the end of the acceleration phase) for off-axis observers. We
also show that the slope of the GW signal before and around the first peak
tracks the jet luminosity history and the structure of the progenitor star. The
amplitude of the GW signal is $h_+D \sim$ hundreds to several thousands cm.
Although this signal, for extragalactic sources, is outside the range of
detectability of current GW detectors, it can be detected by future instruments
as BBO, DECIGO and ALIA. Our results illustrate that future detections of GW
associated to GRB jets may represent a revolution in our understanding of this
phenomenon.","[{'name': 'Gerardo Urrutia'}, {'name': 'Fabio De Colle'}, {'name': 'Claudia Moreno'}, {'name': 'Michele Zanolin'}]","10 pages, 7 Figures; Added discussion; Accepted for publication in

  single WN stars","Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have a severe impact on their environments owing to
their strong ionizing radiation fields and powerful stellar winds. Since these
winds are considered to be driven by radiation pressure, it is theoretically
expected that the degree of the wind mass-loss depends on the initial
metallicity of WR stars. Following our comprehensive studies of WR stars in the
Milky Way, M31, and the LMC, we derive stellar parameters and mass-loss rates
for all seven putatively single WN stars known in the SMC. Based on these data,
we discuss the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the mass loss and
evolution of WR stars. The quantitative analysis of the WN stars is performed
with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The physical
properties of our program stars are obtained from fitting synthetic spectra to
multi-band observations. In all SMC WN stars, a considerable surface hydrogen
abundance is detectable. The majority of these objects have stellar
temperatures exceeding 75 kK, while their luminosities range from 10^5.5 to
10^6.1 Lsun. The WN stars in the SMC exhibit on average lower mass-loss rates
and weaker winds than their counterparts in the Milky Way, M31, and the LMC. By
comparing the mass-loss rates derived for WN stars in different Local Group
galaxies, we conclude that a clear dependence of the wind mass-loss on the
initial metallicity is evident, supporting the current paradigm that WR winds
are driven by radiation. A metallicity effect on the evolution of massive stars
is obvious from the HRD positions of the SMC WN stars at high temperatures and
high luminosities. Standard evolution tracks are not able to reproduce these
parameters and the observed surface hydrogen abundances. Homogeneous evolution
might provide a better explanation for their evolutionary past.","[{'name': 'R. Hainich'}, {'name': 'D. Pasemann'}, {'name': 'H. Todt'}, {'name': 'T. Shenar'}, {'name': 'A. Sander'}, {'name': 'W. -R.

  Star FU Orionis","Context. FU Orionis is the archetypal FUor star, a subclass of young stellar
object (YSO) that undergo rapid brightening events, often gaining 4-6
magnitudes on timescales of days. This brightening is often associated with a
massive increase in accretion; one of the most ubiquitous processes in
astrophysics from planets and stars to super-massive black holes. We present
multi-band interferometric observations of the FU Ori circumstellar
environment, including the first J-band interferometric observations of a YSO.
Aims. We investigate the morphology and temperature gradient of the inner-most
regions of the accretion disk around FU Orionis. We aim to characterise the
heating mechanisms of the disk and comment on potential outburst triggering
processes. Methods. Recent upgrades to the MIRC-X instrument at the CHARA array
allowed the first dual-band J and H observations of YSOs.Using baselines up to
331 m, we present high angular resolution data of a YSO covering the
near-infrared bands J, H, and K. The unprecedented spectral range of the data
allows us to apply temperature gradient models to the innermost regions of FU
Ori. Results. We spatially resolve the innermost astronomical unit of the disk
and determine the exponent of the temperature gradient of the inner disk to
$T=r^{-0.74\pm0.02}$. This agrees with theoretical work that predicts $T =
r^{-0.75}$ for actively accreting, steady state disks, a value only obtainable
through viscous heating within the disk. We find a disk which extends down to
the stellar surface at $0.015\pm0.007$ au where the temperature is found to be
$5800\pm700$ K indicating boundary layer accretion. We find a disk inclined at

channel by which they are formed from low-mass/long-period

explanations involve some variant of double common-envelope (CE) evolution,
however it has been found that such a mechanism cannot produce the observed
distribution. We present a model for the initial episode of mass transfer (MT)

dwarfs need not arise through a double-CE process, as long as the initial
primary's core mass (Md,c) does not exceed 0.46M$_{\odot}$. Instead, the first
episode of dramatic mass loss may be stable, non-conservative MT. We find a
lower bound on the fraction of transferred mass that must be lost from the
system in order to provide for MT, and demonstrate the feasibility of this
channel in producing observed low-mass (with M$_{d,c}$ < 0.46M$_{\odot}$) DWD

star. Extremely precise Doppler spectroscopy is an indispensable tool to find
and characterize earth-like planets; however, to find these planets around
solar-type stars, we need nearly one order of magnitude better radial velocity
(RV) precision than the best current spectrographs provide. Recent developments
in astrophotonics (Bland-Hawthorn & Horton 2006, Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2010)
and adaptive optics (AO) enable single mode fiber (SMF) fed, high resolution
spectrographs, which can realize the next step in precision. SMF feeds have
intrinsic advantages over multimode fiber or slit coupled spectrographs: The
intensity distribution at the fiber exit is extremely stable, and as a result
the line spread function of a well-designed spectrograph is fully decoupled
from input coupling conditions, like guiding or seeing variations (Ihle et al.
2010). Modal noise, a limiting factor in current multimode fiber fed
instruments (Baudrand & Walker 2001), can be eliminated by proper design, and
the diffraction limited input to the spectrograph allows for very compact
instrument designs, which provide excellent optomechanical stability. A SMF is
the ideal interface for new, very precise wavelength calibrators, like laser
frequency combs (Steinmetz et al. 2008, Osterman et al. 2012), or SMF based
Fabry-Perot Etalons (Halverson et al. 2012). At near infrared wavelengths,
these technologies are ready to be implemented in on-sky instruments, or
already in use. We discuss a novel concept for such a spectrograph.","[{'name': 'Christian Schwab'}, {'name': 'Sergio G. Leon-Saval'}, {'name': 'Christopher H.

  cooling","The geometry of the accretion flow around stellar mass and supermassive black
holes depends on the accretion rate. Broad iron emission lines originating from
the irradiation of cool matter can indicate that there is an inner disk below a
hot coronal flow.These emission lines have been detected in X-ray binaries.
Observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM Newton and Suzaku have
confirmed the presence of these emission lines also in a large fraction of
Seyfert-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). We investigate the accretion flow
geometry for which broad iron emission lines can arise in hard and soft
spectral state. We study an ADAF-type coronal flow, where the ions are
viscously heated and electrons receive their heat only by collisions from the
ions and are Compton cooled by photons from an underlying cool disk. For a
strong mass flow in the disk and the resulting strong Compton cooling only a
very weak coronal flow is possible. This limitation allows the formation of
ADAF-type coronae above weak inner disks in the hard state, but almost rules
them out in the soft state. The observed hard X-ray luminosity in the soft
state, of up to 10% or more of the total flux, indicates that there is a
heating process that directly accelerates the electrons. This might point to
the action of magnetic flares of disk magnetic fields reaching into the corona.
Such flares have also been proposed by observations of the spectra of X-ray
black hole binaries without a thermal cut-off around 200 keV.","[{'name': 'E. Meyer-Hofmeister'}, {'name': 'B. F. Liu'}, {'name': 'F.

  astrophysical accretion disks","We provide the possible resolution for the century old problem of
hydrodynamic shear flows, which are apparently stable in linear analysis but
shown to be turbulent in astrophysically observed data and experiments. This
mismatch is noticed in a variety of systems, from laboratory to astrophysical
flows. There are so many uncountable attempts made so far to resolve this
mismatch, beginning with the early work of Kelvin, Rayleigh, and Reynolds
towards the end of the nineteenth century. Here we show that the presence of
stochastic noise, whose inevitable presence should not be neglected in the
stability analysis of shear flows, leads to pure hydrodynamic linear
instability therein. This explains the origin of turbulence, which has been
observed/interpreted in astrophysical accretion disks, laboratory experiments

  Inclination and Age of the System","Debates regarding the age and inclination of the planetary system orbiting HR
8799, and the release of additional astrometric data following the discovery of
the fourth planet prompted us to examine the possibility of constraining these
two quantities by studying the long-term stability of this system at different
orbital inclinations and in its high-mass configuration (7-10-10-10 MJup). We
carried out ~1.5 million N-body integrations for different combinations of
orbital elements of the four planets. The most dynamically stable combinations
survived less than ~5 Myr at inclinations of 0{\deg} and 13{\deg}, and 41, 46,
and 31 Myr at 18{\deg}, 23{\deg}, and 30{\deg}, respectively. Given such short
lifetimes and the location of the system on the age-luminosity diagram for
low-mass objects, the most reasonable conclusion of our study is that the
planetary masses are less than 7-10-10-10 MJup and the system is quite young.
Two trends to note from our work are as follows. (1) In the most stable
systems, the higher the inclination, the more the coordinates for planets b and
c diverge from the oldest archival astrometric data (released after we
completed our N-body integrations), suggesting that either these planets are in
eccentric orbits or have lower orbital inclinations than that of planet d. (2)
The most stable systems place planet e closer to the central star than is
observed, supporting the conclusion that the planets are more massive and the
system is young. We present the details of our simulations and discuss the
implications of the results.","[{'name': 'Jeffrey J. Sudol'}, {'name': 'Nader Haghighipour'}]","Content: 25 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. Submitted for publication on

  foregrounds towards IC342","The new generation of low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the Low
Frequency Array (LOFAR: a Square Kilometre Array-low pathfinder), provides
advancements in our capability of probing Galactic magnetism through
low-frequency polarimetry. Maps of diffuse polarized radio emission and Faraday
rotation can be used to infer properties of, and trace structure in, the
magnetic fields in the ISM. However, to date very little of the sky has been
probed at high angular and Faraday depth resolution. We observed a 5x5 degree
region centred on the nearby galaxy IC342 using LOFAR in the frequency range
115-178 MHz at 4 arcmin resolution and performed Faraday tomography to detect
foreground Galactic polarized synchrotron emission separated by Faraday depth
(different amounts of Faraday rotation). Our Faraday depth cube shows rich
polarized structure, with up to 30 K of polarized emission at 150 MHz. We
detect two overlapping diffuse polarized features that are clearly separated in
Faraday depth. Faraday-thick structures at such low frequencies would be too
strongly depolarized to explain the observations and are therefore rejected.
Only Faraday thin structures will not be strongly depolarized; producing such
structures requires localized variations in the ratio of synchrotron emissivity
to Faraday depth per unit distance, which can arise from several physical
phenomena, such as a transition between regions of ionized and neutral gas. We
conclude that the observed polarized emission is Faraday thin, and propose that
the emission originates from two neutral clouds in the local ISM. We have
modeled the Faraday rotation for this line of sight and estimated that the line
of sight component of magnetic field of the local ISM for this direction varies
between -0.86 and +0.12 uG. We propose that this may be a useful method for
mapping magnetic fields within the local ISM.","[{'name': 'C. L. Van Eck'}, {'name': 'M. Haverkorn'}, {'name': 'M. I. R. Alves'}, {'name': 'R. Beck'}, {'name': 'A. G. de Bruyn'}, {'name': 'T.

redshift we have studied in detail two intervening OVI absorbers at z=2 towards
the quasar PKS1448-232, based on high (R=75,000) and intermediate (R=45,000)
resolution optical VLT/UVES spectra. We find that both absorption systems are
composed of several narrow subcomponents with CIV/OVI Doppler-parameters b<10
km/s, typically. This implies that the gas temperatures are T<10^5 K and that
the absorbers are photoionized by the UV background. The system at z=2.1098
represents a simple, isolated OVI absorber that has only two absorption
components and that is relatively metal-rich (Z\sim 0.6 solar). Ioinization
modeling implies that the system is photoionized with OVI, CIV, and HI
coexisting in the same gas phase. The second system at z=2.1660 represents a
complicated, multi-component absorption system with eight OVI components
spanning almost 300 km/s in radial velocity. The photoionization modeling
implies that the metallicity is non-uniform and relatively low (<= 0.1 solar)
and that the OVI absorption must arise in a gas phase different from that
traced by CIV, CIII, and HI. Our detailed study of the two OVI systems towards
PKS1448-232 shows that multi-phase, multi-component high-ion absorbers like the
one at z=2.1660 require a detailed ionization modeling of the various

long been hypothesized to be drivers of the inflation mechanisms of gaseous
planets and apparent atmospheric chemical disequilibrium conditions. However,
transmission spectra of exoplanets has been limited in its ability to
observational confirm these theories due to the limited wavelength coverage of
HST and inferences of single molecules, mostly H$_2$O. In this work, we present
the panchromatic transmission spectrum of the approximately 750 K, low-density,
Neptune-sized exoplanet WASP-107b using a combination of HST WFC3, JWST NIRCam
and MIRI. From this spectrum, we detect spectroscopic features due to H$_2$O
(21$\sigma$), CH$_4$ (5$\sigma$), CO (7$\sigma$), CO$_2$ (29$\sigma$), SO$_2$
(9$\sigma$), and NH$_3$ (6$\sigma$). The presence of these molecules enable
constraints on the atmospheric metal enrichment (M/H is 10--18$\times$ Solar),
vertical mixing strength (log$_{10}$K$_{zz}$=8.4--9.0 cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), and
internal temperature ($>$345 K). The high internal temperature is suggestive of
tidally-driven inflation acting upon a Neptune-like internal structure, which
can naturally explain the planet's large radius and low density. These findings
suggest that eccentricity driven tidal heating is a critical process governing
atmospheric chemistry and interior structure inferences for a majority of the
cool ($<$1,000K) super-Earth-to-Saturn mass exoplanet population.","[{'name': 'Luis Welbanks'}, {'name': 'Taylor J. Bell'}, {'name': 'Thomas G. Beatty'}, {'name': 'Michael R.

  Forming Brown Dwarfs Unveiled?","On the basis of various data such as ALMA, JVLA, Chandra, {\it Herschel}, and
{\it Spitzer}, we confirmed that two protostellar candidates in Oph-A are bona
fide protostars or proto-brown dwarfs (proto-BDs) in extremely early
evolutionary stages. Both objects are barely visible across infrared (IR, i.e.,
near-IR to far-IR) bands. The physical nature of the cores is very similar to
that expected in first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs), objects theoretically
predicted in the evolutionary phase prior to stellar core formation with gas
densities of $\sim$ 10$^{11-12}$ cm$^{-3}$. This suggests that the evolutionary
stage is close to the FHSC formation phase. The two objects are associated with
faint X-ray sources, suggesting that they are in very early phase of stellar
core formation with magnetic activity. In addition, we found the CO outflow
components around both sources which may originate from the young outflows
driven by these sources. The masses of these objects are calculated to be $\sim
0.01-0.03$ $M_\odot$ from the dust continuum emission. Their physical
properties are consistent with that expected from the numerical model of
forming brown dwarfs. These facts (the X-ray detection, CO outflow association,
and FHSC-like spectral energy distributions) strongly indicate that the two
objects are proto-BDs or will be in the very early phase of protostars which
will evolve more massive protostars if they gain enough mass from the
surroundings. The ages of these two objects are likely to be within $\sim 10^3$
years after the protostellar core (or second core) formation, taking into
account the outflow dynamical times ($\lesssim$ 500 yrs).","[{'name': 'Ryohei Kawabe', 'affiliation': 'NAOJ'}, {'name': 'Chihomi Hara', 'affiliation': 'NAOJ'}, {'name': 'Fumitaka Nakamura', 'affiliation': 'NAOJ'}, {'name': 'Kazuya Saigo', 'affiliation': 'NAOJ'}, {'name': 'Takeshi Kamazaki', 'affiliation': 'NAOJ'}, {'name': 'Yoshito Shimajiri', 'affiliation': 'Sacley'}, {'name': 'Kengo Tomida', 'affiliation': 'Osaka Univ.'}, {'name': 'Shigehisa Takakuwa', 'affiliation': 'Kagoshima Univ.'}, {'name': 'Yohko Tsuboi', 'affiliation': 'Chuo Univ.'}, {'name': 'Masahiro N.

fascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physically
related to compact cores. We briefly describe a new multi-scale,

their parameters in our Herschel images. All of the extracted starless cores
(541 in Aquila and 302 in Polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrow
filaments. With its combination of the far-IR resolution and sensitivity,
Herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;
the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in Aquila
and 59 arcsec in Polaris (9000 AU in both regions). Our first results of
observations with Herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores may
originate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thin
filaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,
interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. To unravel the roles of the
processes, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;
these follow-up observations are planned.","[{'name': ""A. Men'shchikov""}, {'name': 'Ph. André'}, {'name': 'P. Didelon'}, {'name': 'V. Könyves'}, {'name': 'N. Schneider'}, {'name': 'F.

and noise. The machine learning models are trained on a set of air shower

clustering at 0.2<z<1.0 in the PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS). We quantify
the clustering with the redshift-space and projected two-point correlation
functions, xi(rp,pi) and wp(rp), using volume-limited samples constructed from
a parent sample of over 130,000 galaxies with robust redshifts in seven
independent fields covering 9 sq. deg. of sky. We quantify how the
scale-dependent clustering amplitude increases with increasing luminosity and
redder color, with relatively small errors over large volumes. We find that red
galaxies have stronger small-scale (0.1<rp<1 Mpc/h) clustering and steeper
correlation functions compared to blue galaxies, as well as a strong color
dependent clustering within the red sequence alone. We interpret our measured
clustering trends in terms of galaxy bias and obtain values between
b_gal=0.9-2.5, quantifying how galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter
depending on their luminosity and color. We also interpret the color dependence
with mock catalogs, and find that the clustering of blue galaxies is nearly
constant with color, while redder galaxies have stronger clustering in the
one-halo term due to a higher satellite galaxy fraction. In addition, we
measure the evolution of the clustering strength and bias, and we do not detect
statistically significant departures from passive evolution. We argue that the
luminosity- and color-environment (or halo mass) relations of galaxies have not
significantly evolved since z=1. Finally, using jackknife subsampling methods,
we find that sampling fluctuations are important and that the COSMOS field is
generally an outlier, due to having more overdense structures than other

Using [OIV] emission as proxy of AGN intrinsic luminosity, we find that
although type 2 AGNs have higher line equivalent width, the narrow Fe Kalpha
line in Compton-Thin and Compton-Thick Seyfert 2 galaxies are 2.9 +0.8 -0.6 and

for various types of AGNs before the narrow Fe Kalpha line luminosity could
serve as intrinsic AGN luminosity indicator. We also find Seyfert 1 galaxies in
our sample have on average marginally larger line width and higher line
centroid energy, suggesting contamination from highly ionized Fe line or
broader line emission from much smaller radius, but this effect is too weak to
explain the large difference in narrow Fe Kalpha line luminosity between type 1

selected from the Updated Zwicky Catalog according to strict isolation
criteria. Isolated galaxies are not influenced by the group/cluster
environment, and their X-ray emission can be studied independently of the often
overwhelming contribution of the hot intergalactic medium. They are therefore
suited to studying the X-ray characteristics relative to their intrinsic
properties. We analyzed our own XMM-Newton and archival Chandra data in detail
for three objects, and derived, when possible, the spatial and spectral
characteristics of each source. An upper limit for the fourth one was obtained
from archival ASCA data. We compared their characteristics with those of other
23 isolated objects for which X-ray and optical data are available in the
literature. We explored possible theoretical explanations to interpret our
results. In spite of our attempt to select very homogeneous objects, both in
terms of optical properties and environmental characteristics, we find a wide
range in X-ray luminosities and LX/LB ratios for the four objects: two of them
show a hot gaseous halo, whereas no gas is detected in the other two, to a
factor >10 in luminosity. In fact, we find a large spread in the LX/LB for all
galaxies considered, suggesting that the presence of hot gas is not easily
related to the optical luminosity or to the mass, even in isolated systems.
Younger objects tend to be less luminous in X-rays than older systems. However,
it appears that older objects could span a wide range in luminosities.","[{'name': 'Elisabetta Memola'}, {'name': 'Ginevra Trinchieri'}, {'name': 'Anna Wolter'}, {'name': 'Paola Focardi'}, {'name': 'Birgit Kelm'}]","elisabetta.memola@mib.infn.it, 12 pages, 14 PostScript figures, 3

similar to Rubie et al. (2015) but with updates from Dale et al. (2023) to
simulate the chemical evolution of Earth's mantle during metal-silicate
equilibration events from accretional collisions. Our model introduces two key
differences: (1) Earth forms from a dense ring of planetesimals and planetary
embryos near 1 AU, extending into the asteroid belt, and (2) we divide this
population into four zones. The innermost zone contains planetesimals enriched
in refractory elements relative to Si and depleted in volatiles. The remaining
zones represent enstatite, ordinary, and CI chondrites. We fit the Earth's bulk
silicate composition by adjusting the boundaries of these zones and the
refractory enrichment in the inner zone, giving us four compositional free
parameters. A fifth parameter relates to the depth of planetesimal
equilibration after a giant impact. We examined twenty-two ring model
simulations, expanded to forty-eight based on hot or cold targets during
collisions. Seventeen simulations resulted in a mantle chemistry resembling the
bulk silicate Earth (BSE), despite differences in growth sequences. These
variations lead to different fitting parameter values, altering the proportions
of different meteorite types required to match the BSE. However, findings show
Earth must accrete 60-80% of material from the innermost refractory-enriched
zone. This indicates that, with the right growth sequence, multiple ring model
structures can yield an Earth-anaologue composition consistent with the BSE.","[{'name': 'Katherine I. Dale'}, {'name': 'Alessandro Morbidelli'}, {'name': 'David C. Rubie'}, {'name': 'David Nesvorny'}]","15 pages, 7 figures, 1 supplementary figure, 3 tables, accepted in

Galactic SNRs selected from the 74 MHz Very Large Array Low-Frequency Sky
Survey Redux (VLSSr). We combine new integrated measurements from the VLSSr
with flux densities extracted from the GLEAM and measurements from the
literature to generate improved continuum spectra. We combine the VLSSr images
with publicly available images at 1.4 GHz, to analyse the resolved morphology
and spectral index distribution across each SNR. Three of the SNRs, Kepler,
G28.6-0.1, and Tycho, have integrated spectra which can be adequately fit with
simple power laws. The resolved spectral index map for Tycho confirms internal
absorption which was previously detected by the LOFAR, but it is insufficient
to affect the fit to the integrated spectrum. For the pulsar wind nebulae
G21.5-0.9 and 3C58 we identify high-frequency spectral breaks at 38 and 12 GHz,
respectively. A low frequency spectral turnover adequately fits the data of the
remaining nine SNRs. For Kes 67, Kes 69, Kes75, and 3C397, we attribute the
absorption to ionised gas along the line of sight, possibly from extended HII
region envelopes. For W41 the absorption can be attributed to HII regions
located in its immediate proximity. Thermal absorption from interactions at the
ionised interface between SNR forward shocks and the surrounding medium were
previously identified as responsible for the low frequency turnover in SNR
3C391; our integrated spectrum is consistent with the previous results. We
present evidence for the same phenomenon in three additional SNRs, Kes73, W49B,
and 3C396, and derive constraints on the physical properties of the
interaction. This result indicates that interactions between SNRs and their
environs should be readily detectable through thermal absorption by future low
frequency observations of SNRs with improved sensitivity and resolution.","[{'name': 'G. Castelletti'}, {'name': 'L. Supan'}, {'name': 'W. M. Peters'}, {'name': 'N. E. Kassim'}]","Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics (on August

  low- and intermediate-mass stars II. s-process nucleosynthesis during the
  core He flash","Models of primordial and hyper-metal-poor stars with masses similar to the
Sun experience an ingestion of protons into the hot core during the core helium
flash phase at the end of their red giant branch evolution. This produces a
concurrent secondary flash powered by hydrogen burning that gives rise to
further nucleosynthesis in the core. We perform post-process nucleosynthesis
calculations on a one-dimensional stellar evolution calculation of a star of 1
solar mass and metallicity [Fe/H] = -6.5 that suffers a proton ingestion
episode. Our network includes 320 nuclear species and 2,366 reactions and
treats mixing and burning simultaneously. The mixing and burning of protons
into the hot convective core leads to the production of 13C, which then burns
via the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction releasing a large number of free neutrons.
During the first two years of neutron production the neutron poison 14N
abundance is low, allowing the prodigious production of heavy elements such as
strontium, barium, and lead via slow neutron captures (the s process). These
nucleosynthetic products are later mixed to the stellar surface and ejected via
stellar winds. We compare our results with observations of the hyper-metal-poor
halo star HE 1327-2326, which shows a strong Sr overabundance. Our model
provides the possibility of self-consistently explaining the Sr overabundance
in HE 1327-2326 together with its C, N, and O overabundances (all within a
factor of ~4) if the material were heavily diluted, for example, via mass
transfer in a wide binary system. The model produces at least 18 times too much
Ba than observed, but this may be within the large modelling uncertainties. In
this scenario, binary systems of low mass must have formed in the early
Universe. If true then this puts constraints on the primordial initial mass
function.","[{'name': 'Simon W. Campbell'}, {'name': 'Maria Lugaro'}, {'name': 'Amanda I.

  Kepler-16 and 34","Aims. We investigate the feasibility of planetesimal growth in circumbinary
protoplanetary disks around the observed systems Kepler- 16 and Kepler-34 under
the gravitational influence of a precessing eccentric gas disk. Methods. We
embed the results of our previous hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary
disks around binaries into an N-body code to perform 3D, high-resolution,
inter-particle gravity-enabled simulations of planetesimal growth and dynamics
that include the gravitational force imparted by the gas. Results. Including
the full, precessing asymmetric gas disk generates high eccentricity orbits for
planetesimals orbiting at the edge of the circumbinary cavity, where the gas
surface density and eccentricity have their largest values. The gas disk is
able to efficiently align planetesimal pericenters in some regions leading to
phased, non-interacting orbits. Outside of these areas eccentric planetesimal
orbits become misaligned and overlap leading to crossing orbits and high
relative velocities during planetesimal collisions. This can lead to an
increase in the number of erosive collisions that far outweighs the number of
collisions that result in growth. Gravitational focusing from the static
axisymmetric gas disk is weak and does not significantly alter collision
outcomes from the gas free case. Conclusions. Due to asymmetries in the gas
disk, planetesimals are strongly perturbed onto highly eccentric orbits. Where
planetesimals orbits are not well aligned, orbit crossings lead to an increase
in the number of erosive collisions. This makes it difficult for sustained
planetesimal accretion to occur at the location of Kepler-16b and Kepler-34b
and we therefore rule out in-situ growth. This adds further support to our
initial suggestions that most circumbinary planets should form further out in
the disk and migrate inwards.","[{'name': 'S. Lines'}, {'name': 'Z. M. Leinhardt'}, {'name': 'C. Baruteau'}, {'name': 'S. -J. Paardekooper'}, {'name': 'P. J.

those worlds are expected to be subject to important irradiation from their
host star, and display supercritical water layers surrounded by extended steam
atmospheres. Irradiated ocean planets with such inflated hydrospheres have been
recently shown to be good candidates for matching the mass-radius distribution
of sub-Neptunes. Here we describe a model that computes a realistic structure
for water-rich planets by combining an interior model with an updated equation
of state (EoS) for water, and an atmospheric model that takes into account
radiative transfer. We find that the use of non appropriate EoSs can lead to
the overestimation of the planetary radius by up to $\sim$10\%, depending on
the planet size and composition. Our model has been applied to the GJ 9827
system as a test case and indicates Earth- or Venus-like interiors for planets
b and c, respectively. Planet d could be an irradiated ocean planet with a
water mass fraction of $\sim$$20\pm10\%$. We also provide fits for the
mass-radius relationships, allowing one to directly retrieve a wide range of
planetary compositions, without the requirement to run the model. Our
calculations finally suggest that highly irradiated planets lost their H/He
content through atmospheric loss processes, and that the leftover material led
to either super-Earths or sub-Neptunes, depending on the water mass fraction.","[{'name': 'Artyom Aguichine'}, {'name': 'Olivier Mousis'}, {'name': 'Magali Deleuil'}, {'name': 'Emmanuel Marcq'}]",Accepted for publication in ApJ,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01102v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/abfa99', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01102v1']",astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],10.3847/1538-4357/abfa99,

modes, we numerically explore the scaling relations with resistivity $\eta$ and
Prandtl number $P_m$ during the magnetic reconnection phase, and compare to the
generalized steady-state SP theoretical solution. The usual Sweet-Parker
relations are recovered in the limit of small $P_m$ and $\eta$ values, with in
particular the normalized reconnection rate being simply $S^{-1/2} (1 +
P_m)^{-1/4}$, where $S$ represents the Lundquist number $S = LV_A/\eta$ ($V_A$
being the characteristic Alfv\'en speed). In the opposite limit of higher $P_m$
and/or $\eta$ values, a significant deviation from the SP model is obtained
with a complex dependence $B_e (\eta, P_m)$ that is explored depending on the
setup considered. We discuss the importance of these results in order to
correctly interpret the numerous exponentially increasing numerical studies
published in the literature, with the aim of explaining eruptive phenomena
observed in the solar corona.",{'name': 'Hubert Baty'},"16 pages, 13 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01135v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01135v1,astro-ph.SR,"['astro-ph.SR', 'hep-th']",,

  X-ray astronomy data","The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) have developed a new Python module, X-ray:
Generate and Analyse (XGA) to provide interactive and automated analyses of
X-ray emitting sources observed by the XMM-Newton space telescope. XGA only
requires that a set of cleaned, processed, event lists has been created, and
(optionally) that a source detector has generated region lists for the
observations. XGA is centered around the concept of making all available data
easily accessible and analysable. The user provides information (e.g. RA, Dec,
redshift) on the source they wish to investigate, and XGA locates relevant
observations and generates required data products. This allows the user to
quickly and easily complete common analyses using all relevant observations,
thus being left free to focus on extracting the maximum scientific gain. XGA is
centered around source and sample classes, which represent different types of
X-ray emitting astrophysical objects and have different properties and methods
relevant to that type of object. XGA also contains product classes, which
provide interfaces to X-ray data products or information (such as radial
profiles) that have been derived from them, with built-in methods for fitting,
analysis, and visualisation. XGA can fit models to spectra (both global and
annular) with XSPEC, measuring spectral properties such as temperature, photon
index, and luminosity. XGA can also measure radial profiles of density and
temperature for galaxy clusters, allowing the measurement of gas and total mass
profiles of galaxy clusters. In the future, we will add support for X-ray
telescopes other than XMM (e.g. Chandra, eROSITA), as well as the ability to
perform multi-mission joint analyses. With the advent of new X-ray
observatories such as eROSITA, XRISM, ATHENA, and Lynx, it is the perfect time
for a new, open-source, software package that is open for anyone to use and
scrutinise.","[{'name': 'D. J. Turner'}, {'name': 'P. A. Giles'}, {'name': 'A. K. Romer'}, {'name': 'V. Korbina'}]","7 pages, 3 figures, added more future plans, draft before submission

massive galaxies, using the DR11 main galaxy sample of the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-III (CMASS galaxies), and the DR7 quasar spectra
of SDSS-II. The cross-correlation is measured by stacking quasar absorption
spectra shifted to the redshift of galaxies that are within a certain impact
parameter bin of the quasar, after dividing by a quasar continuum model. This
results in an average MgII equivalent width as a function of impact parameter
from a galaxy, ranging from 50 kpc to more than 10 Mpc in proper units, which
includes all MgII absorbers. We show that special care needs to be taken to use
an unbiased quasar continuum estimator, to avoid systematic errors in the
measurement of the mean stacked MgII equivalent width. The measured
cross-correlation follows the expected shape of the galaxy correlation
function, although measurement errors are large. We use the cross-correlation
amplitude to derive the bias factor of MgII absorbers, finding bMgII = 2.33
\pm? 0.19, where the error accounts only for the statistical uncertainty in
measuring the mean equivalent width. This bias factor is larger than that
obtained in previous studies and may be affected by modeling uncertainties that
we discuss, but if correct it suggests that MgII absorbers at redshift z \simeq
0:5 are spatially distributed on large scales similarly to the CMASS galaxies
in BOSS.

its formation history. Iron is the most abundant transition metal, but has
never been directly detected in an exoplanet due to its highly refractory
nature. KELT-9b (HD 195689b) is the archetype of the class of ultra-hot
Jupiters that straddle the transition between stars and gas-giant exoplanets
and serve as distinctive laboratories for studying atmospheric chemistry,
because of its high equilibrium temperature of 4050 +/- 180 K. These properties
imply that its atmosphere is a tightly constrained chemical system that is
expected to be nearly in chemical equilibrium and cloud-free. It was previously
predicted that the spectral lines of iron will be detectable in the visible
range of wavelengths. At these high temperatures, iron and several other
transition metals are not sequestered in molecules or cloud particles and exist
solely in their atomic forms. Here, we report the direct detection of atomic
neutral and singly-ionized iron (Fe and Fe+), and singly-ionized titanium (Ti+)

history is not well known. We report CO(4$\rightarrow$3) and continuum map
observations of the SpARCS1049+56 BCG at $z=1.709$, one of the most distant
known BCGs. Our observations yield $M_{{\rm H}_2}<1.1\times10^{10}M_\odot$ for
the BCG; while in CO(4$\rightarrow$3), we detect two gas-rich companions at the
northeast and southeast of the BCG, within 20 kpc, with ${L^\prime_{\rm

directly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse Compton
scattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. Conservative limits
are derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observed

distribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the Galaxy, the index of the
injection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of the
interstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,
while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derived
from fits to local cosmic-ray data. The resulting limits impact the range of

  cluster NGC 2808 using AstroSat","A recent study of hot (20,000 to 30,000 K) extreme horizontal branch (EHB)
stars in globular clusters (GCs) has led to the discovery of their variability.
It is suggested that this variability is driven by the projected rotation of
magnetic spots on the stellar surfaces and is expected to have higher
amplitudes at shorter wavelengths. Here, we present the analysis of such hot
stars in the massive GC NGC 2808 using the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope
(UVIT), aboard AstroSat. We use the UVIT data in combination with the Hubble
Space Telescope UV Globular Cluster Survey (HUGS) data for the central region
(within $\sim$ $2.7'$ $\times$ $2.7'$) and ground-based optical photometry for
the outer parts of the cluster. We generate the far-UV (FUV) - optical
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and in these we find a population of hot EHB
stars fainter than the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) model. A comparison of
our FUV magnitudes of the already reported variable EHB stars (vEHBs) shows
that the longest period vEHBs are the faintest, along with a tentative
correlation between rotation period and UV magnitude of spotted stars. In order
to firmly establish any correlation, further study is essential.","[{'name': 'Deepthi S. Prabhu'}, {'name': 'Annapurni Subramaniam'}, {'name': 'Snehalata Sahu'}]","10 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. Accepted for publication in Journal of

Kepler satellite in short-cadence mode. To minimize errors in the estimated
stellar parameters, we divided the instability strip into ten regions and
determined the mean frequency distribution in each region. We confirm that the
presence of low frequencies is a property of all Delta Scuti stars, rendering
meaningless the concept of Delta Sct/Gamma Dor hybrids. We obtained the true
distribution of equatorial rotational velocities in each region and calculated
the frequency distributions predicted by pulsation models, taking into account
rotational splitting of the frequencies. We confirm that rotation cannot
account for the presence of low frequencies. We calculated a large variety of
standard pulsation models with different metal and helium abundances, but were
unable to obtain unstable low-frequency modes driven by the kappa mechanism in
any model. We also constructed models with modified opacities in the envelope.
Increasing the opacity at a temperature log T = 5.06 by a factor of two does
lead to instability of low-degree modes at low frequencies, but also decreases
the frequency range of Delta Sct-type pulsations to some extent. We also
re-affirm the fact that less than half of the stars in the Delta Sct
instability strip have pulsations detectable by Kepler. We also point out the
huge variety of frequency patterns in stars with roughly similar parameters,
suggesting that nonlinearity is an important factor in Delta Sct pulsations.","[{'name': 'L. A. Balona'}, {'name': 'J. Daszynska-Daszkiewicz'}, {'name': 'A. A.

  Cosmology Telescope Polarization experiment measurements","The gas depletion factor $\gamma(z)$, i.e., the average ratio of the gas mass
fraction to the cosmic mean baryon fraction of galaxy clusters, plays a very
important role in the cosmological application of the gas mass fraction
measurements. In this paper, using the newest catalog of 182 galaxy clusters
detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Polarization experiment, we
investigate the possible redshift evolution of $\gamma(z)$ through a new
cosmology-independent method. The method is based on non-parametric
reconstruction using the measurements of Hubble parameters from cosmic
chronometers. Unlike hydrodynamical simulations suggesting constant depletion
factor, our results reveal the trend of $\gamma(z)$ decreasing with redshift.
This result is supported by a parametric model fit as well as by calculations
on the reduced ACTPol sample and on the alternative sample of 91 SZ clusters
reported earlier in ACT compilation. Discussion of possible systematic effects
leaves an open question about validity of the empirical relation
$M_{tot}$-$f_{gas}$ obtained on very close clusters. These results might pave
the way to explore the hot gas fraction within large radii of galaxy clusters
as well as its possible evolution with redshift, which should be studied

the second order spatial correlation of the light emitted from a star. The
physical information provided by these measurements is the angular size and
structure of the emitting source. A worldwide effort is presently under way to
implement stellar intensity interferometry on telescopes separated by long
baselines and on future arrays of Cherenkov telescopes. We describe an
experiment of this type, realized at the Asiago Observatory (Italy), in which
we performed for the first time measurements of the correlation counting photon
coincidences in post-processing by means of a single photon software correlator
and exploiting entirely the quantum properties of the light emitted from a
star. We successfully detected the temporal correlation of Vega at zero
baseline and performed a measurement of the correlation on a projected baseline
of $\sim$2 km. The average discrete degree of coherence at zero baseline for
Vega is $< g^{(2)} > \, = 1.0034 \pm 0.0008$, providing a detection with a
signal-to-noise ratio $S/N \gtrsim 4$. No correlation is detected over the km
baseline. The measurements are consistent with the expected degree of spatial
coherence for a source with the 3.3 mas angular diameter of Vega. The

errors and selection effects. We survey some of the key ideas astronomers have
developed to deal with these complications, in the context of galaxy surveys
and the literature on corrections for Malmquist and Eddington bias. From the
perspective of modern statistics, such corrections arise naturally in the
context of multilevel models, particularly in Bayesian treatments of such
models: hierarchical Bayesian models. We survey some key lessons from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling, including shrinkage estimation, which is
closely related to traditional corrections devised by astronomers. We describe
a framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of cosmic populations, tailored
to features of astronomical surveys that are not typical of surveys in other
disciplines. This thinned latent marked point process framework accounts for
the tie between selection (detection) and measurement in astronomical surveys,
treating selection and measurement error effects in a self-consistent manner.","[{'name': 'Thomas J. Loredo'}, {'name': 'Martin A. Hendry'}]","33 pages, 5 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12337v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12337v1,astro-ph.IM,"['astro-ph.IM', 'stat.AP']",,

  Quasars","We report the discovery, spectroscopic confirmation and preliminary
characterisation of 24 gravitationally lensed quasars identified using Gaia
observations. Candidates were selected in the Pan-STARRS footprint with
quasar-like WISE colours or as photometric quasars from SDSS, requiring either
multiple detections in Gaia or a single Gaia detection near a morphological
galaxy. The Pan-STARRS grizY images were modelled for the most promising
candidates and 60 candidate systems were followed up with the William Herschel
Telescope. 13 of the lenses were discovered as Gaia multiples and 10 as single
Gaia detections near galaxies. We also discover 1 lens identified through a
quasar emission line in an SDSS galaxy spectrum. The lenses have median image
separation 2.13 arcsec and the source redshifts range from 1.06 to 3.36. 4
systems are quadruply-imaged and 20 are doubly-imaged. Deep CFHT data reveal an
Einstein ring in one double system. We also report 12 quasar pairs, 10 of which
have components at the same redshift and require further follow-up to rule out
the lensing hypothesis. We compare the properties of these lenses and other
known lenses recovered by our search method to a complete sample of simulated
lenses to show the lenses we are missing are mainly those with small
separations and higher source redshifts. The initial Gaia data release only
catalogues all images of ~ 30% of known bright lensed quasars, however the

diversity of X-ray lightcurves within the rho variability class of the
microquasar GRS 1915+105. This 'heartbeat' state is characterized by a bright
flare that recurs every ~50-100 seconds, but the profile and duration of the
flares varies significantly from observation to observation. Based on a
comprehensive, phase-resolved study of heartbeats in the RXTE archive, we
demonstrate that very different X-ray lightcurves do not require origins in
different accretion processes. Indeed, our detailed comparison of the
phase-resolved spectra of a double-peaked oscillation and a single-peaked
oscillation shows that different cycles can have basically similar X-ray
spectral evolution. We argue that all heartbeat oscillations can be understood
as the result of a combination of a thermal-viscous radiation pressure
instability, a local Eddington limit in the disk, and a sudden,
radiation-pressure-driven evaporation or ejection event in the inner accretion
disk. This ejection appears to be a universal, fundamental part of the rho
state, and is largely responsible for a hard X-ray pulse seen in the lightcurve
of all cycles. We suggest that the detailed shape of oscillations in the mass
accretion rate through the disk is responsible for the phenomenological
differences between different rho-type lightcurves, and we discuss how future
time-dependent simulations of disk instabilities may provide new insights into
the role of radiation pressure in the accretion flow.","[{'name': 'Joseph Neilsen', 'affiliation': ['MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research', 'Harvard University', 'Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics']}, {'name': 'Ronald A.

  Type Ia supernovae","The progenitor system(s) and the explosion mechanism(s) of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) are still under debate. Non-electromagnetic observables, in particular
gravitational waves and neutrino emission, of thermonuclear supernovae are a
complementary window to light curves and spectra for studying these enigmatic
objects. A leading model for SNe Ia is the thermonuclear incineration of a
near-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf star in a
""delayed-detonation"". We calculate a three-dimensional hydrodynamic explosion
for the N100 delayed-detonation model extensively discussed in the literature,
taking the dynamical effects of neutrino emission from all important
contributing source terms into account. Although neutrinos carry away $2 \times
10^{49}$ erg of energy, we confirm the common view that neutrino energy losses
are dynamically not very important, resulting in only a modest reduction of the
final kinetic energy by two per cent. We then calculate the gravitational wave
signal from the time evolution of the quadrupole moment. Our model radiates $7
\times 10^{39}$ erg in gravitational waves and the spectrum has a pronounced
peak around 0.4 Hz. Depending on viewing angle and polarization, we find that
the future space-based gravitational wave missions DECIGO and BBO would be able
to detect our source to a distance of 1.3 Mpc. We predict a clear signature of
the deflagration-to-detonation transition in the neutrino and the gravitational
wave signals. If observed, such a feature would be a strong indicator of the
realization of delayed-detonations in near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs.","[{'name': 'Ivo R. Seitenzahl'}, {'name': 'Matthias Herzog'}, {'name': 'Ashley J.

  Cluster","We present the full results of our 3-year long Submillimeter Array survey of
protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We imaged 23 fields at 880
microns and 2 fields at 1330 microns, covering an area of ~6.5 arcmin^2 and
containing 67 disks. We detected 42 disks with fluxes between 6-135 mJy and at
rms noise levels between 0.6 to 5.3 mJy/beam. Thermal dust emission above any
free-free component was measured in 40 of the 42 detections, and the inferred
disk masses range from 0.003-0.07 Msolar. We find that disks located within 0.3
pc of theta^1 Ori C have a truncated mass distribution, while disks located
beyond 0.3 pc have masses more comparable to those found in low-mass star
forming regions. The disk mass distribution in Orion has a distance dependence,
with a derived relationship max(M_(disk)) = 0.046Msolar(d/0.3pc)^0.33 for the
maximum disk masses. We found evidence of grain growth in disk 197-427, the
only disk detected at both 880 microns and 1330 microns with the SMA. Despite
the rapid erosion of the outer parts of the Orion disks by photoevaporation,

investigate the nature of the power-law shape of xi(r), the galaxy two-point
correlation function. Departures from a power law are mainly governed by galaxy
pair counts on small scales, subject to non-linear dynamics. We assume that
galaxies reside within dark matter halos and subhalos and use a semi-analytic
substructure evolution model to study subhalo populations within host halos. We
find that tidal mass loss and, to a lesser degree, dynamical friction deplete
the number of subhalos within larger host halos over time by ~90%, just the
right amount for achieving a power-law xi(r) at z = 0. We find that xi(r)
breaks from a power law at high masses, implying that only galaxies of
luminosities <= Lstar should exhibit power-law clustering. We also demonstrate
that xi(r) evolves from being far from a power law at high redshift, toward a
near power law at z = 0 and deviates in the future. This is mainly caused by
the evolving competition between the accretion and destruction rates of
subhalos, which happen to strike just the right balance at z~0. We show that
key ingredients determining the shape of xi(r) are the fraction of galaxies
that are satellites, the relative difference in mass between the halos of
isolated galaxies and halos that contain a single satellite on average, and the
rareness of halos that host galaxies. These pieces are intertwined and we find
no simple, universal rule for which a power-law xi(r) will occur. However, we
do show that the physics responsible for setting the galaxy content of halos do
not care about the conditions needed to achieve a power law xi(r) and these
conditions are met only in a narrow mass and redshift range. We conclude that
the power-law nature of xi(r) for Lstar and fainter galaxy samples at low
redshift is a cosmic coincidence. (Abridged)","[{'name': 'Douglas F. Watson'}, {'name': 'Andreas A. Berlind'}, {'name': 'Andrew R. Zentner'}]","20 pages, 9 figures.

  electron-proton plasma","The expansion of a charge-neutral cloud of electrons and positrons with the
temperature 1 MeV into an unmagnetized ambient plasma is examined with a 2D
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The pair outflow drives solitary waves in
the ambient protons. Their bipolar electric fields attract electrons of the
outflowing pair cloud and repel positrons. These fields can reflect some of the
protons thereby accelerating them to almost an MeV. Ion acoustic solitary waves
are thus an efficient means to couple energy from the pair cloud to protons.
The scattering of the electrons and positrons by the electric field slows down
their expansion to a nonrelativistic speed. Only a dilute pair outflow reaches
the expansion speed expected from the cloud's thermal speed. Its positrons are
more energetic than its electrons. In time an instability grows at the front of
the dense slow-moving part of the pair cloud, which magnetizes the plasma. The
instability is driven by the interaction of the outflowing positrons with the
protons. These results shed light on how magnetic fields are created and ions
are accelerated in pair-loaded astrophysical jets and winds.","[{'name': 'ME Dieckmann'}, {'name': 'A Alejo'}, {'name': 'G Sarri'}]","8 pages, 7 figures, updated figure 6 and corrected typos. Physics of

implement a Cauchy-Riemann based algorithm to recover images from simulated

with different telescopes to detect signatures of massive planets around
main-sequence and evolved stars of the open cluster (OC) M67. We aimed to
perform a long-term study on giant planet formation in open clusters and
determine how this formation depends on stellar mass and chemical composition.
A new hot Jupiter (HJ) around the main-sequence star YBP401 is reported in this

single stars and ~4.5% for the full sample ). This rate is much higher than
what has been discovered in the field, either with RV surveys or by transits.
High metallicity is not a cause for the excess of HJs in M67, nor can the
excess be attributed to high stellar masses. When combining this rate with the
non-zero eccentricity of the orbits, our results are qualitatively consistent

from NS--NS or NS--BH mergers is dense in neutrinos. We present the first study
on the role of angular distributions in the neutrino flavor conversion above
the remnant disk. In particular, we focus on ""fast"" pairwise conversions whose
rate depends on the local angular intensity of the electron lepton number
carried by neutrinos. Because of the emission geometry and the flux density of
$\bar{\nu}_e$ being larger than that of $\nu_e$, fast conversions prove to be a
generic phenomenon in NS--NS and NS--BH mergers for physically motivated
disturbances in the mean field of flavor coherence. Our findings suggest that,

are necessary to explain observations of exoplanet atmospheres, most recently
of WASP 96b with JWST. Understanding the formation of cloud condensation nuclei
in non-terrestrial environments is therefore crucial to develop accurate models
to interpret present and future observations. Aims. The goal of the paper is to
support observations with infrared spectra for (TiO2)N clusters in order to
study cloud formation in exoplanet atmospheres. Methods. Vibrational
frequencies are derived from quantum-chemical calculations for 123
(TiO2)-clusters and their isomers, and line-broadening mechanisms are
evaluated. Cluster spectra are calculated for several atmospheric levels for
two example exoplanet atmospheres (WASP 121b-like and WASP 96b-like) to
identify possible spectral fingerprints for cloud formation. Results.
Rotational motion of and transitions in the clusters cause significant line
broadening, so that individual vibrational lines are broadened beyond the
spectral resolution of the medium resolution mode of the JWST mid-infrared
instrument MIRI at R = 3000. However, each individual cluster isomer exhibits a
""fingerprint"" IR spectrum. In particular, larger (TiO2)-clusters have
distinctly different spectra from smaller clusters. Morning and evening
terminator for the same planet can exhibit different total absorbances due to
different cluster sizes being more abundant. Conclusions. The largest
(TiO2)-clusters are not necessarily the most abundant (TiO2)-clusters in the
high-altitude regions of ultra-hot Jupiters, and the different cluster isomers
will contribute to the local absorbance. Planets with a considerable day-night
asymmetry will be most suitable to search for (TiO2)-cluster isomers in order
to improve cloud formation modelling.","[{'name': 'J. P. Sindel'}, {'name': 'Ch. Helling'}, {'name': 'D. Gobrecht'}, {'name': 'K. L. Chubb'}, {'name': 'L.

  systems: ambipolar diffusion and reconnection","Radial substructures in circumstellar disks are now routinely observed by
ALMA. There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such
disks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps
develop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of
tens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD
effect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately
coupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current
steepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic
field sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic
torque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly
pinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates
magnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion
rate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger
poloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically
coupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop
continuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more
chaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in
part, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal
field and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the
reconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The
formation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has
interesting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and
planet formation.","[{'name': 'Scott S.

evolution of galaxy clusters. However, their properties are largely unknown,
and measuring magnetic fields in galaxy clusters is challenging, especially on
large-scales outside of individual radio sources. In this work, we probe the
plane-of-the-sky orientation of magnetic fields in clusters using the intensity
gradients. The technique is a branch of the Gradient Technique (GT) that
employs emission intensity maps from turbulent gas. We utilize the Chandra
X-ray images of the Perseus, M 87, Coma, and A2597 galaxy clusters, and the VLA
radio observations of the synchrotron emission from Perseus. We find that the
fields predominantly follow the sloshing arms in Perseus, which is in agreement
with numerical simulations. The GT-predicted magnetic field shows signatures of
magnetic draping around rising bubbles driven by supermassive black hole (SMBH)
feedback in the centers of cool-core clusters, as well as draping around
substructures merging with the Coma cluster. We calculate the mean-field
orientation with respect to the radial direction in these clusters. In the
central regions of cool-core clusters, the mean orientation of the magnetic
fields is preferentially azimuthal. There is a broad agreement between the
magnetic field of Perseus predicted using the X-ray and radio data. Further
numerical studies and better future observations with higher resolution and the
larger effective area will help reduce the uncertainties of this method.","[{'name': 'Yue Hu'}, {'name': 'A.

order to study its globular cluster (GC) population out to large galactocentric
distances. We discuss particularly the relationship between GC effective radii
$r_h$ and projected galactocentric distance $R_{gc}$. The observations suggest
a shallow trend $r_h \propto R_{gc}^{0.14}$ out to $R_{gc} \sim 100$ kpc, in
agreement with studies of other giant elliptical galaxies. To theoretically
reproduce this relationship we simulate GC populations with various
distributions of orbits. For an isotropic distribution of cluster orbits we
find a steeper trend of $r_h \propto R_{gc}^{0.4}$. Instead we suggest that (a)
if the cluster system has an orbital anisotropy profile, where orbits become
preferentially radial with increasing galactocentric distance, AND (b) if
clusters become more tidally under-filling with galactocentric distance, the
observed relationship can be recovered. We also apply this approach to the red

preferentially under-filling at large $R_{gc}$ and have a more isotropic
distribution of orbits than blue clusters.","[{'name': 'Jeremy J. Webb'}, {'name': 'Alison Sills'}, {'name': 'William E.

distribution is approximated with modified black body functions considering
dust components with different temperatures, allowing to determine the
temperatures and relative column densities of the dust components.
  We apply the model to the nearby galaxy M31 using the Spitzer Space Telescope
far-infrared observations for mapping dust distribution and temperature. A warm
and a cold dust component are distinguished. The temperature of the warm dust
in M31 varies between 56 and 60 K and is highest in the spiral arms; the
temperature of the cold component is mostly 15-19 K and rises up to about 25 K
at the centre of the galaxy. The intensity-weighted mean temperature of the
dust decreases from T ~32 K at the centre to T ~20 K at R ~7 kpc and outwards.
We also calculate the intrinsic UBVRIL surface brightness distributions and the

are enriched by rather complex molecules. Many of these molecules are believed
to be synthesized on the icy surfaces of the interstellar submicron-sized dust
grains that permeate the Galaxy. At 10 K thermal desorption is ineffcient and,
therefore, why these molecules are found in the cold gas has tantalized
astronomers for years. The assumption of the current models, called chemical
desorption, is that the molecule formation energy released by the chemical
reaction at the grain surface is partially absorbed by the grain and the
remaining one causes the ejection of the newly formed molecule into the gas.
Here we report an accurate ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations aimed to
study the fate of the energy released by the first reaction of the H addition
chain on CO, CO + H $\rightarrow$ HCO, occurring on a crystalline ice surface
model. We show that about 90% of the HCO formation energy is injected towards
the ice in the first picosecond, leaving HCO with an energy content (10-15 kJ
mol$^{-1}$) more than a factor two lower than its adsorption energy (30 kJ
mol$^{-1}$). As a result, in agreement with laboratory experiments, we conclude
that chemical desorption is ineffcient for this specific system, namely H + CO
on crystalline ice. We suspect this behavior to be quite general when dealing
with hydrogen bonds, which are responsible of both the cohesive energy of the
ice mantle and the interaction with adsorbates, as the HCO radical, even though
ad hoc simulations are needed to draw specific conclusions on other systems.","[{'name': 'Stefano Pantaleone'}, {'name': 'Joan Enrique-Romero'}, {'name': 'Cecilia Ceccarelli'}, {'name': 'Piero Ugliengo'}, {'name': 'Nadia Balucani'}, {'name': 'Albert Rimola'}]",Appendix not included.

  heating sources and seasonal effects","The observations made during the Voyager 2 flyby have shown that the
stratosphere of Uranus and Neptune are warmer than expected by previous models.
In addition, no seasonal variability of the thermal structure has been observed
on Uranus since Voyager 2 era and significant subseasonal variations have been
revealed on Neptune. In this paper, we evaluate different realistic heat
sources that can induce sufficient heating to warm the atmosphere of these
planets and we estimate the seasonal effects on the thermal structure. The
seasonal radiative-convective model developed by the Laboratoire de
M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique is used to reproduce the thermal structure of these
planets. Three hypotheses for the heating sources are explored separately:
aerosol layers, a higher methane mole fraction, and thermospheric conduction.
Our modelling indicates that aerosols with plausible scattering properties can
produce the requisite heating for Uranus, but not for Neptune. Alternatively,
greater stratospheric methane abundances can provide the missing heating on
both planets, but the large values needed are inconsistent with current
observational constraints. In contrast, adding thermospheric conduction cannot
warm alone the stratosphere of both planets. The combination of these heat
sources is also investigated. In the upper troposphere of both planets, the
meridional thermal structures produced by our model are found inconsistent with
those retrieved from Voyager 2/IRIS data. Furthermore, our models predict
seasonal variations should exist within the stratospheres of both planets while
observations showed that Uranus seems to be invariant to meridional contrasts
and only subseasonal temperature trends are visible on Neptune. However, a warm
south pole is seen in our simulations of Neptune as observed since 2003.","[{'name': 'G. Milcareck'}, {'name': 'S. Guerlet'}, {'name': 'F. Montmessin'}, {'name': 'A. Spiga'}, {'name': 'J.

function of environment based on data from the zCOSMOS survey. There is a fair
amount of evidence that galaxy properties depend on mass of groups and
clusters, in the sense that quiescent galaxies prefer more massive systems. We
base our analysis on a mass-selected environment using X-ray groups of galaxies
and define the group membership using a large number of spectroscopic redshifts
from zCOSMOS. We show that the fraction of red galaxies is higher in groups
than in the field at all redshifts probed in our study. Interestingly, the
fraction of [OII] emitters on the red sequence increases at higher redshifts in
groups, while the fraction does not strongly evolve in the field. This is due
to increased dusty star formation activities and/or increased activities of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in high redshift groups. We study these
possibilities using the 30-band photometry and X-ray data. We find that the
stellar population of the red [OII] emitters in groups is old and there is no
clear hint of dusty star formation activities in those galaxies. The observed
increase of red [OII] emitters in groups is likely due to increased AGN
activities. However, our overall statistics is poor and any firm conclusions
need to be drawn from a larger statistical sample of z~1 groups.","[{'name': 'M. Tanaka'}, {'name': 'A. Finoguenov'}, {'name': 'S. J. Lilly'}, {'name': 'M. Bolzonella'}, {'name': 'C. M.

  abundance of haloes","We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how the
inclusion of physical processes relevant to galaxy formation (star formation,
metal-line cooling, stellar winds, supernovae and feedback from Active Galactic
Nuclei, AGN) change the properties of haloes, over four orders of magnitude in
mass. We find that gas expulsion and the associated dark matter (DM) expansion
induced by supernova-driven winds are important for haloes with masses M200 <
10^13 Msun, lowering their masses by up to 20% relative to a DM-only model. AGN
feedback, which is required to prevent overcooling, has a significant impact on
halo masses all the way up to cluster scales (M200 ~ 10^15 Msun). Baryonic
physics changes the total mass profiles of haloes out to several times the
virial radius, a modification that cannot be captured by a change in the halo
concentration. The decrease in the total halo mass causes a decrease in the
halo mass function of about 20%. This effect can have important consequences
for abundance matching technique as well as for most semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation. We provide analytic fitting formulae, derived from
simulations that reproduce the observed baryon fractions, to correct halo
masses and mass functions from DM-only simulations. The effect of baryonic
physics (AGN feedback in particular) on cluster number counts is about as large
as changing the cosmology from WMAP7 to Planck, even when a moderately high
mass limit of M500 ~ 10^14 Msun is adopted. Thus, for precision cosmology the
effects of baryons must be accounted for.","[{'name': 'Marco Velliscig', 'affiliation': 'Leiden Observatory, Leiden University'}, {'name': 'Marcel P. van Daalen', 'affiliation': ['Leiden Observatory, Leiden University', 'Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics']}, {'name': 'Joop Schaye', 'affiliation': 'Leiden Observatory, Leiden University'}, {'name': 'Ian G.

gamma-rays by colliding with the dense interstellar medium. In this paper, we
report the search for high-energy gamma-ray emission from several nearby

luminosity suggests that cosmic rays in NGC~2146 convert most of their energy
into secondary pions, so NGC~2146 is a ""proton calorimeter"". It is also found
that NGC~2146 obeys the quasi-linear scaling relation between the gamma-ray
luminosity and total infrared luminosity for star-forming galaxies,
strengthening the connection between massive star formation and gamma-ray

neutron stars, which results in large amplitude stellar oscillations. To model
this process we use a Newtonian hydrodynamic code, with a high resolution
shock-capturing scheme. The physical process considered is a sudden phase
transition from normal nuclear matter to a mixed phase of quark and nuclear
matter. We show that both the temperature and the density at the neutrinosphere
oscillate with time. However, they are nearly 180 degree out of phase.
Consequently, extremely intense, pulsating neutrino/antineutrino and leptonic
pair fluxes will be emitted. During this stage several mass ejecta can be
ejected from the stellar surface by the neutrinos and antineutrinos. These
ejecta can be further accelerated to relativistic speeds by the

outside the stellar surface. We suggest that this process may be a possible

Star complexes located in this arm are all spaced 1.2 kpc apart and have
similar sizes of about 0.6 kpc. Within the same arm region Beck et al. (1989)
detected a regular magnetic field, and we found that its wavelength is the
spacing between the complexes. In this arm, groups of HII regions lie inside
star complexes, which, in turn, are located inside the gas and dust lane. In
contrast, the southwestern arm of M31 splits into a gas and dust lane upstream
and a dense stellar arm downstream, with HII regions located mostly along the
boundary between these components of the arm. The stellar density in the
southwestern arm is much higher than in the northwestern arm, and the former is
not fragmented into star complexes. The age gradient across this arm have been
found in earlier observations. According the classical SDW theory, these
drastic differences may be due due to their different pitch angles: about 0
degree for northwestern part of the arm and about 30 degree for the
southwestern segment. Data on M31, M51, M74, and some other galaxies suggest
that star complexes are mostly located in the arm segments that are not
accompanied by a dust lane upstream, i.e. do not host spiral shock wave. The
regularities in the distribution of complexes along a density wave spiral arm
are most probably due to the development of the Parker-Jeans instability, which

fast magnetic reconnection events as a powerful mechanism operating in the core
region, near the jet base of black hole sources on more solid ground. For
microquasars and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) the observed
correlation between radio emission and mass of the sources can be explained by
this process. The corresponding gamma-ray emission also seems to be produced in
the same core region. On the other hand, the emission from blazars and
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) cannot be correlated to core emission based on fast
reconnection.","[{'name': 'C. B. Singh'}, {'name': 'E. M. de Gouveia Dal Pino'}, {'name': 'L. H. S. Kadowaki'}]","5 pages, 3 figures. Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical

  Astrophysics","Computational astrophysics has undergone unprecedented development over the
last decade, becoming a field of its own. The challenge ahead of us will
involve increasingly complex multi-scale simulations. These will bridge the gap
between areas of astrophysics such as star and planet formation, or star
formation and galaxy formation, that have evolved separately until today. A
global knowledge of the physics and modeling techniques of astrophysical
simulations is thus an important asset for the next generation of modelers.
With the aim at fostering such a global approach, we present the Special Issue
on Computational Astrophysics for the Advanced Science Letters
(http://www.aspbs.com/science.htm). The Advanced Science Letters (ASL) is a new
multi-disciplinary scientific journal which will cover extensively
computational astrophysics and cosmology, and will act as a forum for the
presentation and discussion of novel work attempting to connect different
research areas. This Special Issue collects 9 reviews on 9 key topics of modern
astrophysics and cosmology in which simulations have had a pivotal
contribution. From asteroid collisions to the formation of stars, from the
physics and origin of galaxy clusters to large-scale phenomena such as the
reionization of the Universe, it is a showcase of state-of-the-art numerical
work in a diverse range of topics. The 9 reviews are available on today's

on their HB, we present an analysis of the composition of 110 red HB (RHB)
stars in 47 Tucanae and of 61 blue HB (BHB) and 30 RHB stars in M5. In 47 Tuc
we found tight relations between the colours of the stars and their abundances
of p-capture elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content -
which is expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture
elements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age) that
determines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He abundance must be
small (Delta Y<0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our observations; this agrees with
previous analyses. There is possibly a correlation between the abundances of p-
and n-capture elements in 47 Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that AGB
stars of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation
stars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which does not
include stars warmer than 11000 K and RR Lyrae variables) is important to
understand our results for M5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB
stars are Na-poor and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population.
There is a clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour
along the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low
value of Y=0.22\pm 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a putative
He-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11000 K, and would
accordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However, we need some
additional source of scatter in the total mass loss of stars climbing up the
RGB to reproduce our results for M5. Finally, we found a C-star on the HB of 47
Tuc and a Ba-rich, fast-rotating, likely binary star on the HB of M5. These
stars are among the brightest and coolest HB stars.","[{'name': 'R. G. Gratton'}, {'name': 'S. Lucatello'}, {'name': 'A. Sollima'}, {'name': 'E. Carretta'}, {'name': 'A. Bragaglia'}, {'name': 'Y.

form of decretion discs. They are often members of binary systems, where it is
expected that the decretion disc interacts both radiatively and gravitationally
with the companion. In this work we study how various orbital (period, mass
ratio and eccentricity) and disc (viscosity) parameters affect the disc
structure in coplanar systems. We simulate such binaries with the use of a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. The main effects of the secondary on the
disc are its truncation and the accumulation of material inwards of truncation.
We find two cases with respect to the effects of eccentricity: (i) In circular
or nearly circular prograde orbits, the disc maintains a rotating, constant in
shape, configuration, which is locked to the orbital phase. The disc is smaller
in size, more elongated and more massive for low viscosity parameter, small
orbital separation and/or high mass ratio. (ii) Highly eccentric orbits are
more complex, with the disc structure and total mass strongly dependent on the
orbital phase and the distance to the secondary. We also study the effects of
binarity in the disc continuum emission. Since the infrared and radio SED are
sensitive to the disc size and density slope, the truncation and matter
accumulation result in considerable modifications in the emergent spectrum. We
conclude that binarity can serve as an explanation for the variability
exhibited in observations of Be stars, and that our model can be used to detect
invisible companions.","[{'name': 'Despina Panoglou'}, {'name': 'Alex C. Carciofi'}, {'name': 'Rodrigo G. Vieira'}, {'name': 'Isabelle H. Cyr'}, {'name': 'Carol E. Jones'}, {'name': 'Atsuo T.

are in particular interested in the closest companions as they would have a
strong influence on the evolution of the original planet forming disks. In this
study we present new companions detected during our ongoing survey of exoplanet
hosts with VLT/SPHERE. We are using the extreme adaptive optics imager SPHERE
at the ESO/VLT to search for faint (sub)stellar companions. We utilized the
classical coronagraphic imaging mode to perform a snapshot survey (3-6 min
integration time) of exoplanet host stars in the Ks-band. We detected new
stellar companions to the exoplanet host stars HD1666, HIP68468, HIP107773, and
HD109271. With an angular separation of only 0.38"" (40 au of projected
separation) HIP107773 is among the closest companions found to exoplanet host
stars. The presence of the stellar companion explains the linear
radial-velocity trend seen in the system. At such a small separation the
companion likely had significant influence on the evolution of the planet
forming disk around the primary star. We find that the companion in the HD1666
system may well be responsible for the high orbit eccentricity (0.63) of the
detected Jupiter class planet, making this system one of only a few where such
a connection can be established. A cross-match with the Gaia DR2 catalog showed
furthermore that the near infrared faint companion around HD109271 had been
detected in the optical and is significantly brighter than in the near infrared

high resolution N-body simulation of a Milky-Way-size galaxy, to investigate
the phase-space structure of the Galactic halo. We show that the annihilation

  LCDM and MOND","The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) is an empirical relation between
baryonic mass and rotation velocity in disk galaxies. It provides tests of
galaxy formation models in LCDM and of alternative theories like MOND.
Observations of gas rich galaxies provide a measure of the slope and
normalization of the BTFR that is more accurate (if less precise) than that
provided by star dominated spirals, as their masses are insensitive to the
details of stellar population modeling. Recent independent data for such
galaxies are consistent with Mb = AVf^4 with A = 47+/-6 Msun (km/s)^-4. This is
equivalent to MOND with $a_0 = 1.3 +/- 0.3 A/s/s. The scatter in the data is
consistent with being due entirely to observational uncertainties. It is
unclear why the physics of galaxy formation in LCDM happens to pick out the
relation predicted by MOND. We introduce a feedback efficacy parameter E to
relate halo properties to those of the galaxies they host. E correlates with
star formation rate and gas fraction in the sense that galaxies that have
experienced the least star formation have been most impacted by feedback.","{'name': 'Stacy McGaugh', 'affiliation': 'University of Maryland'}","Astronomical Journal, in press. Added new figure (7 total); new

  and complicates dynamical modeling in low-mass galaxies","In low-mass galaxies, stellar feedback can drive gas outflows that generate
non-equilibrium fluctuations in the gravitational potential. Using cosmological
zoom-in baryonic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)
project, we investigate how these fluctuations affect stellar kinematics and
the reliability of Jeans dynamical modeling in low-mass galaxies. We find that
stellar velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles fluctuate significantly
over the course of galaxies' starburst cycles. We therefore predict an
observable correlation between star formation rate and stellar kinematics:
dwarf galaxies with higher recent star formation rates should have systemically
higher stellar velocity dispersions. This prediction provides an observational
test of the role of stellar feedback in regulating both stellar and dark-matter
densities in dwarf galaxies. We find that Jeans modeling, which treats galaxies
as virialized systems in dynamical equilibrium, overestimates a galaxy's
dynamical mass during periods of post-starburst gas outflow and underestimates
it during periods of net inflow. Short-timescale potential fluctuations lead to
typical errors of $\sim 20\%$ in dynamical mass estimates, even if full
3-dimensional stellar kinematics -- including the orbital anisotropy -- are
known exactly. When orbital anisotropy is $\textit{not}$ known a priori,
typical mass errors arising from non-equilibrium fluctuations in the potential
are larger than those arising from the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. However,
Jeans modeling alone $\textit{cannot}$ reliably constrain the orbital
anisotropy, and problematically, it often favors anisotropy models that do not
reflect the true profile. If galaxies completely lose their gas and cease
forming stars, fluctuations in the potential subside, and Jeans modeling
becomes much more reliable.","[{'name': 'Kareem El-Badry'}, {'name': 'Andrew R. Wetzel'}, {'name': 'Marla Geha'}, {'name': 'Eliot Quataert'}, {'name': 'Philip F.

  layer","Thermal evolution models suggest that the luminosities of both Uranus and
Neptune are inconsistent with the classical assumption of an adiabatic
interior. Such models commonly predict Uranus to be brighter and, recently,
Neptune to be fainter than observed. In this work, we investigate the influence
of a thermally conductive boundary layer on the evolution of Uranus- and
Neptune-like planets. This thermal boundary layer (TBL) is assumed to be
located deep in the planet, and be caused by a steep compositional gradient
between a H-He-dominated outer envelope and an ice-rich inner envelope. We
investigate the effect of TBL thickness, thermal conductivity, and the time of
TBL formation on the planet's cooling behaviour. The calculations were
performed with our recently developed tool based on the Henyey method for
stellar evolution. We make use of state-of-the-art equations of state for
hydrogen, helium, and water, as well as of thermal conductivity data for water
calculated via ab initio methods. We find that even a thin conductive layer of
a few kilometres has a significant influence on the planetary cooling. In our
models, Uranus' measured luminosity can only be reproduced if the planet has
been near equilibrium with the solar incident flux for an extended time. For
Neptune, we find a range of solutions with a near constant effective
temperature at layer thicknesses of 15 km or larger, similar to Uranus. In
addition, we find solutions for thin TBLs of few km and strongly enhanced
thermal conductivity. A $\sim$ 1$~$Gyr later onset of the TBL reduces the
present $\Delta T$ by an order of magnitude to only several 100 K. Our models
suggest that a TBL can significantly influence the present planetary luminosity
in both directions, making it appear either brighter or fainter than the
adiabatic case.","[{'name': 'Ludwig Scheibe'}, {'name': 'Nadine Nettelmann'}, {'name': 'Ronald Redmer'}]","accepted to A&A, Reproduced with permission from Astronomy &

However, it is possible to further exploit these upcoming data by using the

  Low-Metallicity Dwarf Galaxy NGC 6822 and the Milky Way","We present the ALMA survey of CO(2-1) emission from the 1/5 solar
metallicity, Local Group dwarf galaxy NGC 6822. We achieve high (0.9 arcsec ~ 2
pc) spatial resolution while covering large area: four 250 pc x 250 pc regions
that encompass ~2/3 of NGC 6822's star formation. In these regions, we resolve
~150 compact CO clumps that have small radii (~2-3 pc), narrow line width (~1
km/s), and low filling factor across the galaxy. This is consistent with other
recent studies of low metallicity galaxies, but here shown with a 15 times
larger sample. At parsec scales, CO emission correlates with 8 micron emission
better than with 24 micron emission and anti-correlates with Halpha, so that
PAH emission may be an effective tracer of molecular gas at low metallicity.
The properties of the CO clumps resemble those of similar-size structures in
Galactic clouds except of slightly lower surface brightness and CO-to-H2 ratio
~1-2 times the Galactic value. The clumps exist inside larger atomic-molecular
complexes with masses typical for giant molecular cloud. Using dust to trace H2
for the entire complex, we find CO-to-H2 to be ~20-25 times the Galactic value,
but with strong dependence on spatial scale and variations between complexes
that may track their evolutionary state. The H2-to-HI ratio is low globally and
only mildly above unity within the complexes. The SFR-to-H2 ratio is ~3-5 times
higher in the complexes than in massive disk galaxies, but after accounting for
the bias from targeting star-forming regions, we conclude that the global
molecular gas depletion time may be as long as in massive disk galaxies.","[{'name': 'Andreas Schruba'}, {'name': 'Adam K. Leroy'}, {'name': 'J. M.

  atmospheric conditions","A large fraction of the organic species produced photochemically in the
atmosphere of Titan can condense to form ice particles in the stratosphere and
in the troposphere. According to various studies, diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$)
condenses below 100 km where it can be exposed to ultraviolet radiation. We
studied experimentally the photochemistry of diacetylene ice (C$_4$H$_2$) to
evaluate its potential role in the lower altitude photochemistry of Titan's
atmospheric ices. Methods. C$_4$H$_2$ ice films were irradiated with
near-ultraviolet (near-UV) photons ( {\lambda} > 300 nm) with different UV
sources to assess the impact of the wavelengths of photons on the
photochemistry of C$_4$H$_2$. The evolution of the ice's composition was
monitored using spectroscopic techniques. Our results reveal that diacetylene
ice is reactive through singlet-triplet absorption, similar to the
photochemistry of other organic ices of Titan (such as dicyanoacetylene
C$_4$N$_2$ ice) that we investigated previously. Several chemical processes
occurred during the photolysis: the hydrogenation of C$_4$H$_2$ to form other
C$_4$ hydrocarbons (vinylacetylene C$_4$H$_4$ to butane C$_4$H$_{10}$); the
formation of larger and highly polymerizable hydrocarbons, such as triacetylene
(C$_6$H$_2$); and the formation of an organic polymer that is stable at room
temperature. The nondetection of diacetylene ice in Titan's atmosphere or
surface could be rationalized based on our experimental results that C$_4$H$_2$
is photochemically highly reactive in the solid phase when exposed to near-UV
radiation that reaches Titan's lower altitudes and surface. C$_4$H$_2$ may be
one of the key molecules promoting the chemistry in the ices and aerosols of
Titan's haze layers, especially in the case of co-condensation with other
organic volatiles, with which it could initiate more complex solid-phase
chemistry.","[{'name': 'Benjamin Fleury'}, {'name': 'Murthy S.

Structure in Galaxies (S4G) were measured at 3.6mu, where extinction is small
and the old stars dominate. The sample includes flocculent, multiple arm, and

optically flocculent galaxies are also flocculent in the mid-IR because of star
formation uncorrelated with stellar density waves, whereas multiple arm and
grand design galaxies have underlying stellar waves. Arm-interarm contrasts
increase from flocculent to multiple arm to grand design galaxies and with
later Hubble types. Structure can be traced further out in the disk than in
previous surveys. Some spirals peak at mid-radius while others continuously
rise or fall, depending on Hubble and bar type. We find evidence for regular
and symmetric modulations of the arm strength in NGC 4321. Bars tend to be
long, high amplitude, and flat-profiled in early type spirals, with arm
contrasts that decrease with radius beyond the end of the bar, and they tend to
be short, low amplitude, and exponential-profiled in late Hubble types, with
arm contrasts that are constant or increase with radius. Longer bars tend to

  due to bulge-bar and disk shocking","We calculate orbits, tidal radii, and bulge-bar and disk shocking destruction
rates for 63 globular clusters in our Galaxy. Orbits are integrated in both an
axisymmetric and a non-axisymmetric Galactic potential that includes a bar and
a 3D model for the spiral arms. With the use of a Monte Carlo scheme, we
consider in our simulations observational uncertainties in the kinematical data
of the clusters. In the analysis of destruction rates due to the bulge-bar, we
consider the rigorous treatment of using the real Galactic cluster orbit,
instead of the usual linear trajectory employed in previous studies. We compare
results in both treatments. We find that the theoretical tidal radius computed
in the nonaxisymmetric Galactic potential compares better with the observed
tidal radius than that obtained in the axisymmetric potential. In both Galactic
potentials, bulge-shocking destruction rates computed with a linear trajectory
of a cluster at its perigalacticons give a good approximation to the result
obtained with the real trajectory of the cluster. Bulge-shocking destruction
rates for clusters with perigalacticons in the inner Galactic region are
smaller in the non-axisymmetric potential, as compared with those in the
axisymmetric potential. For the majority of clusters with high orbital

  in the UV-Vis range","Laboratory results of the optical properties of vapor-deposited water ice,
specifically the refractive index and extinction coefficient, are available
mainly for a selective set of wavelengths and a limited number of deposition
temperatures. Experimental limitations are the main reason for the lack of
broadband data, which is unfortunate as these quantities are needed to
interpret and predict astronomical and planetary observations. The goal of this
work is to address these lacking data, using an experimental broadband method
that is capable of rapidly providing reliable water ice data across the entire
UV-visible range. This approach combines the simultaneous use of a
monochromatic HeNe laser and a broadband Xe-arc lamp to record interference
fringes of water ice during deposition at astronomically relevant ice
temperatures. The ice thickness is typically more than 20 $\mu$m. Analyzing the
period and intensity patterns combining both the monochromatic and broadband
interference patterns allows the determination of the wavelength-dependent
refractive index and extinction coefficient. We present accurate refractive
index and extinction coefficient graphs for wavelengths between 250 and 750 nm
and ices deposited between 30 and 160 K. From our data, we find a possible
structural change in the ice in the 110-130 K region that has not been reported

Earth-like worlds: when the incoming stellar flux cannot be balanced by
radiation to space, the oceans evaporate and exacerbate heating, turning the
planet into a hot wasteland with a steam atmosphere overlying a possibly molten
magma surface. The equilibrium state beyond the runaway greenhouse instellation
limit depends on the radiative properties of the atmosphere and its temperature
structure. Here, we use 1-D radiative-convective models of steam atmospheres to
explore the transition from the tropospheric radiation limit to the
post-runaway climate state. To facilitate eventual simulations with 3-D global
circulation models, a computationally efficient band-grey model is developed,
which is capable of reproducing the key features of the more comprehensive
calculations. We analyze two factors which determine the equilibrated surface
temperature of post-runaway planets. The infrared cooling of the planet is
strongly enhanced by the penetration of the dry adiabat into the optically thin
upper regions of the atmosphere. In addition, thermal emission of both
shortwave and near-IR fluxes from the hot lower atmospheric layers, which can
radiate through window regions of the spectrum, is quantified. Astronomical
surveys of rocky exoplanets in the runaway greenhouse state may discriminate
these features using multi-wavelength observations.","[{'name': 'Ryan Boukrouche'}, {'name': 'Tim Lichtenberg'}, {'name': 'Raymond T. Pierrehumbert'}]","Accepted for publication in ApJ; 19 pages, 11 figures; Summary video

donor star, which contributes 20% of the total flux at 5200-6800 Angs. The
photometric 0.703 +/- 0.003 d periodicity observed during outburst is 2.6%
longer than the orbital period supporting the presence of a superhump
modulation in the outburst lightcurves. In line with this interpretation, we
constrain the binary mass ratio to be q=0.12. In addition, we observe a sharp
increase in the Halpha emission line equivalent width during inferior
conjunction of the donor star that we interpret as a grazing eclipse of the
accretion disc and allows us to constrain the binary inclination to > 69 deg.
On the other hand, the absence of X-ray eclipses during outburst imply i < 77
deg. These inclination limits, together with our dynamical solution, lead to a
black hole mass in the range 7-8 Msun. We also measure a systemic velocity =

described by a power-law component plus a blackbody component. The former is
dominated by unpulsed emission and is probably originated from the pulsar wind
nebula as reported by Hui et al (2015). The emission property of the blackbody
component is consistent with the emission from the polar cap heated by the
back-flow bombardment of the high-energy electrons or positrons that were
accelerated in the magnetosphere. We found no significant change in the X-ray
emission properties between two states. We suggest that the change of the X-ray
luminosity is at an order of ~4%, which is difficult to measure with the

are low-temperature detectors with inherent spectral resolution that are able
to instantly register individual photons with potentially no false counts or
readout noise. These properties make MKIDs transformative for exoplanet direct
imaging by enabling photon-statistics-based planet-discrimination techniques as
well as performing conventional noise-subtraction techniques on shorter
timescales. These detectors are in the process of rapid development, and as
such, the full extent of their performance enhancing potential has not yet be
quantified.
  MKID Exoplanet Direct Imaging Simulator, or MEDIS, is a general-purpose
end-to-end numerical simulator for high-contrast observations with MKIDs. The
simulator exploits current optical propagation libraries and augments them with
a new MKIDs simulation module to provide a pragmatic model of many of the
degradation effects present during the detection process. We use MEDIS to
demonstrate how changes in various MKID properties affect the
contrast-separation performance when conventional differential imaging
techniques are applied to low-flux, short duration observations.
  We show that to improve performance at close separations will require
increasing the maximum count rate or pixel sampling when there is high residual
flux after the coronagraph. We predict that taking pixel yield from the value
achieved by current instruments of 80% and increasing it to 100% would result
in an improvement in contrast of a factor of $\sim$ 4 at 3$\lambda/D$ and
$\sim$ 8 at 6$\lambda/D$. Achieving better contrast performance in this low

arrival time statistics.","[{'name': 'R. H. Dodkins'}, {'name': 'K. Davis'}, {'name': 'B. Lewis'}, {'name': 'S. Mahashabde'}, {'name': 'B. A. Mazin'}, {'name': 'I. A. Lipartito'}, {'name': 'N.

  excitation","The terrestrial planets formed by accretion of asteroid-like objects within
the inner solar system's protoplanetary disk. Previous works have found that
forming a small-mass Mars requires the disk to contain little mass beyond ~1.5
au (i.e., the disk mass was concentrated within this boundary). The asteroid
belt also holds crucial information about the origin of such a narrow disk.
Several scenarios may produce a narrow disk. However, simultaneously
replicating the four terrestrial planets and the inner solar system properties
remains elusive. Here, we found that chaotic excitation of disk objects
generated by a near-resonant configuration of Jupiter-Saturn can create a
narrow disk, allowing the formation of the terrestrial planets and the asteroid
belt. Our simulations showed that this mechanism could typically deplete a
massive disk beyond ~1.5 au on a 5-10 Myr timescale. The resulting terrestrial
systems reproduced the current orbits and masses of Venus, Earth and Mars.
Adding an inner region disk component within ~0.8-0.9 au allowed several
terrestrial systems to simultaneously form analogues of the four terrestrial
planets. Our terrestrial systems also frequently satisfied additional
constraints: Moon-forming giant impacts occurring after a median ~30-55 Myr,
late impactors represented by disk objects formed within 2 au, and effective
water delivery during the first 10-20 Myr of Earth's formation. Finally, our
model asteroid belt explained the asteroid belt's orbital structure, small mass
and taxonomy (S-, C- and D/P-types).","[{'name': 'Patryk Sofia Lykawka'}, {'name': 'Takashi Ito'}]","Accepted for publication in Scientific Reports. 71 pages, 12 figures,

are produced dynamically. Therefore the fraction of type Ia supernovae that
explode in globular clusters is expected to be higher than the fraction of mass
residing in these. We have searched for globular clusters at the positions of
observed type Ia supernovae. We used archival HST images and literature data,
covering the positions either before the supernovae exploded, or long enough
after that the supernovae have faded below the luminosities of globular
clusters. We did not find evidence for globular clusters at any of the
supernova positions. For 18 type Ia supernovae, the observations are sensitive
enough that any globular cluster would have been detected, and for further 17
type Ia supernovae, the brighter globular clusters would have been detected.
Correcting for incompleteness, we derive a 90% upper limit of 0.09 on the
fraction of type Ia supernovae that explode in globular clusters for the full
sample and 0.22 for the sample of supernovae in late-type galaxies. This allows
us to limit enhancements per unit stellar mass for a coeval population

elusive, with a few candidates whose high-$z$ nature is still to be confirmed.
Interpreting this lack of detections is crucial to improve our understanding of
high-$z$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formation and growth. In this work,
we present a model for the emission of accreting BHs in the X-ray band, taking
into account super-Eddington accretion, which can be very common in gas-rich
systems at high-$z$. We compute the spectral energy distribution for a sample
of active galaxies simulated in a cosmological context, which represent the
progenitors of a $z \sim 6$ SMBH with $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^9 \, M_\odot$. We
find an average Compton thick fraction of $\sim 45\%$ and large typical column
densities ($N_H \gtrsim 10^{23} \rm \, cm^2$). However, faint progenitors are
still luminous enough to be detected in the X-ray band of current surveys. Even
accounting for a maximum obscuration effect, the number of detectable BHs is
reduced at most by a factor 2. In our simulated sample, observations of faint
quasars are mainly limited by their very low active fraction ($f_{\rm act} \sim
1 \%$), which is the result of short, super-critical growth episodes. We
suggest that to detect high-$z$ SMBHs progenitors, large area surveys with
shallower sensitivities, such as Cosmos Legacy and XMM-LSS+XXL, are to be
preferred with respect to deep surveys probing smaller fields, such as CDF-S.","[{'name': 'Edwige Pezzulli'}, {'name': 'Rosa Valiante'}, {'name': 'Maria C.

host stars are clues about the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
Earlier work found evidence for a peak near $90^\circ$ in the distribution of
stellar obliquities, based on frequentist tests. We performed hierarchical
Bayesian inference on a sample of 174 planets for which either the full
three-dimensional stellar obliquity has been measured (72 planets) or for which
only the sky-projected stellar obliquity has been measured (102 planets). We
investigated whether the obliquities are best described by a Rayleigh
distribution, or by a mixture of a Rayleigh distribution representing
well-aligned systems and a different distribution representing misaligned
systems. The mixture models are strongly favored over the single-component
distribution. For the misaligned component, we tried an isotropic distribution
and a distribution peaked at 90$^\circ$, and found the evidence to be
essentially the same for both models. Thus, our Bayesian inference engine did
not find strong evidence favoring a ""perpendicular peak,'' unlike the
frequentist tests. We also investigated selection biases that affect the
inferred obliquity distribution, such as the bias of the gravity-darkening
method against obliquities near $0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$. Further progress in
characterizing the obliquity distribution will probably require the
construction of a more homogeneous and complete sample of measurements.","[{'name': 'Jared Siegel'}, {'name': 'Joshua Winn'}, {'name': 'Simon Albrecht'}]","15 pages, accepted to ApJ Letters",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13400v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/acd62f', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13400v1']",astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],10.3847/2041-8213/acd62f,

is preferentially concentrated, estimate the amplitude of stellar differential
rotation, and look for short-term activity cycles as, e.g., in the case of
CoRoT-2. In the case of a late-type star accompanied by a transiting hot

Advanced Technology telescopes, for six objects in the inner classical Kuiper
Belt. Objects in the inner classical Kuiper Belt are of interest as they may
represent the surviving members of the primordial Kuiper Belt that formed
interior to the current position of the 3:2 resonance with Neptune, the current
position of the plutinos, or, alternatively, they may be objects formed at a
different heliocentric distance that were then moved to their present
locations. The six new colors, combined with four previously published, show
that the 10 inner belt objects with known colors form a neutral clump and a
reddish clump in B-R color. Nonparametric statistical tests show no significant
difference between the B-R color distribution of the inner disk objects
compared to the color distributions of Centaurs, plutinos, or scattered disk
objects. However, the B-R color distribution of the inner classical Kuiper belt
objects does differ significantly from the distribution of colors in the cold
(low inclination) main classical Kuiper belt. The cold main classical objects
are predominately red, while the inner classical belt objects are a mixture of
neutral and red. The color difference may reveal the existence of a gradient in
the composition and /or surface processing history in the primordial Kuiper
Belt, or indicate that the inner disk objects are not dynamically analogous to
the cold main classical belt objects.","[{'name': 'W. Romanishin'}, {'name': 'S. C. Tegler'}, {'name': 'G. J.

with the 2012 July 23 extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). Characteristics of
the shock determined from multi-point imaging observations are compared to in
situ measurements at different locations and a complex radio type II burst,
which according to our definition has multiple branches that may not all be
fundamental-harmonic related. The white-light shock signature can be modeled
reasonably well by a spherical structure and was expanding backward even on the
opposite side of the Sun. The expansion of the shock, which was roughly
self-similar after the first $\sim$1.5 hours from launch, largely dominated
over the translation of the shock center for the time period of interest. Our
study also suggests a bow-shock morphology around the nose at later times due
to the outward motion in combination with the expansion of the ejecta. The
shock decayed and failed to reach Mercury in the backward direction and STEREO
B and Venus in the lateral directions, as indicated by the imaging and in situ
observations. The shock in the nose direction, however, may persist to the far
outer heliosphere, with predicted impact on Dawn around 06 UT on July 25 and on
Jupiter around 23:30 UT on July 27 by an MHD model. The type II burst shows
properties generally consistent with the spatial/temporal variations of the
shock deduced from imaging and in situ observations. In particular, the
low-frequency bands agree well with the in situ measurements of a very low
density ahead of the shock at STEREO A.","[{'name': 'Ying D. Liu'}, {'name': 'Huidong Hu'}, {'name': 'Bei Zhu'}, {'name': 'Janet G.

molecular gas as such a tracer. We present here Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 7052
at 0.11 arcseconds (37 pc) resolution in the 12CO(2-1) line and 1.3mm continuum

potential is dominated by the SMBH. We forward model these observations, using
a multi-Gaussian expansion of a Hubble Space Telescope F814W image and
spatially-constant mass-to-light ratio to model the stellar mass distribution.
We infer a SMBH mass of $2.5\pm0.3\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and a stellar
I-band mass-to-light ratio of $4.6\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{M_\odot/L_{\odot,I}}$

that derived using ionised gas kinematics, which however appear significantly

investigate the role played by the shock velocity and by the electron

highest average speed. This result is consistent with the loss-limited
framework. We also find that the electron acceleration in both nonthermal limbs
of SN 1006 proceeds close to the Bohm diffusion limit, the gyrofactor being in
the range 1.5-4. We finally investigate possible explanations for the low

(CEE) of a white dwarf (WD) and an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and find
that the potential number of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the core
degenerate (CD) and from the double degenerate (DD) scenarios are of the same
order of magnitude. For the CD scenario we consider cases where a carbon oxygen
rich (CO) AGB core and a CO WD merge during the CEE and leave a WD remnant with
a mass of >1.35Mo, and for the DD scenario we count surviving CO WD binary
systems that merge within a time of 10 Gyr. When either the AGB core or the WD
are oxygen neon rich (ONe) we assume that the outcome might be a peculiar SN
Ia. We find that the number of potential peculiar SNe Ia in the channels we
study, that do not include peculiar SNe Ia that involve helium WDs or helium
donors, is non-negligible, but less than the number of normal SNe Ia. If a SN
Ia or a peculiar SN Ia explosion takes place within about million year after
CEE, whether in the CD scenario or in the DD scenario, a massive circumstellar
matter is present at explosion time. Our results are compatible with the
suggestion that Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia mostly come from the CD scenario, and

  artificial neural networks about feature noise","Cosmic shear is a primary cosmological probe for several present and upcoming
surveys investigating dark matter and dark energy, such as Euclid or WFIRST.
The probe requires an extremely accurate measurement of the shapes of millions
of galaxies based on imaging data. Crucially, the shear measurement must
address and compensate for a range of interwoven nuisance effects related to
the instrument optics and detector, noise, unknown galaxy morphologies, colors,
blending of sources, and selection effects. This paper explores the use of
supervised machine learning (ML) as a tool to solve this inverse problem. We
present a simple architecture that learns to regress shear point estimates and
weights via shallow artificial neural networks. The networks are trained on
simulations of the forward observing process, and take combinations of moments
of the galaxy images as inputs. A challenging peculiarity of this ML
application is the combination of the noisiness of the input features and the
requirements on the accuracy of the inverse regression. To address this issue,
the proposed training algorithm minimizes bias over multiple realizations of
individual source galaxies, reducing the sensitivity to properties of the
overall sample of source galaxies. Importantly, an observational selection
function of these source galaxies can be straightforwardly taken into account
via the weights. We first introduce key aspects of our approach using toy-model
simulations, and then demonstrate its potential on images mimicking Euclid
data. Finally, we analyze images from the GREAT3 challenge, obtaining
competitively low shear biases despite the use of a simple training set. We
conclude that the further development of ML approaches is of high interest to
meet the stringent requirements on the shear measurement in current and future
surveys. A demonstration implementation of our technique is publicly available.","[{'name': 'Malte Tewes'}, {'name': 'Thibault Kuntzer'}, {'name': 'Reiko Nakajima'}, {'name': 'Frédéric Courbin'}, {'name': 'Hendrik Hildebrandt'}, {'name': 'Tim Schrabback'}]","31 pages, 26 figures, minor changes to match the version published in

formation. High column densities and complex kinematical structures make direct
observations challenging and they only provide a snapshot. Chemical tracers
provide an interesting alternative to characterise the infall histories of
protostars. Previous observations of H13CO+ towards the low-mass protostar
IRAS15398-3359 showed a depression in the abundance. This is a sign of
destruction of HCO+ by an enhanced presence of gaseous water in an extended
region, possibly related to a recent burst in the accretion. Direct
observations of water vapour can determine the exact extent of the emission and
confirm the hypothesis that HCO+ is indeed a good tracer of the water
snow-line. IRAS15398 was observed using ALMA at 0.5"" resolution. Maps of
HDO(101-000) and H218O(414-321) were taken simultaneously with observations of
the CS(8-7) and N2H+(5-4) lines and continuum at 0.65 and 0.75 mm. The maps
were interpreted using dust radiative transfer calculations of the protostellar
infalling envelope with an outflow cavity. HDO is clearly detected and extended
over the scales of the H13CO+ depression, although it is displaced by ~500 AU
in the direction of the outflow. H218O is tentatively detected towards the
red-shifted outflow lobe, but otherwise it is absent from the mapped region,
which suggests that temperatures are low. Based on the temperature structure
obtained from dust radiative transfer models, we conclude that the water was
most likely released from the grains in an extended hour-glass configuration
during a recent accretion burst. HDO is only detected in the region closest to
the protostar, at distances of up to 500 AU. These signatures can only be
explained if the luminosity has recently been increased by orders of
magnitudes. Additionally, the densities in the outflow cones must be
sufficiently low.","[{'name': 'P. Bjerkeli'}, {'name': 'J. K. Jørgensen'}, {'name': 'E. A. Bergin'}, {'name': 'S. Frimann'}, {'name': 'D. Harsono'}, {'name': 'S. K. Jacobsen'}, {'name': 'J. E.

  Discs. II. The Effects of Opacity and Thermal Evolution","Dust trapping in the global pressure bump induced by magnetospheric
truncation offers a promising formation mechanism for close-in
super-Earths/sub-Neptunes. These planets likely form in evolved protoplanetary
discs, where the gas temperature at the expanding truncation radius become
amiable to refractory solids. However, dust accumulation may alter the disc
opacity such that thermal evolution is inevitable. To better understand how
thermodynamics affects this planet formation pathway, we conduct a suite of
local dust evolution simulations in an idealized inner disc model. Our
calculations take into account self-consistent opacity-dependent temperature
changes as well as dust evaporation and vapour condensation. We find that disc
thermal evolution regulates dust growth and evolution, discouraging any
accumulation of small particles that drives the increase of opacity and
temperature. Significant retention of dust mass takes place when the disc
environments allow runaway growth of large solids beyond the fragmentation
barrier, where small particles are then swept up and preserved. Our results
further validate dust accumulation near disc truncation as a promising
mechanism to form close-in planets.","[{'name': 'Rixin Li'}, {'name': 'Yi-Xian Chen'}, {'name': 'Douglas N. C. Lin'}]","Accepted by MNRAS and in production; 11 pages, 8 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14463v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14463v1,astro-ph.EP,"['astro-ph.EP', 'astro-ph.SR']",,

technique and efficiency of RFI identification and mitigation for the 21
Centimeter Array (21CMA), a radio interferometer dedicated to the statistical
measurement of EoR. For terrestrial, man-made RFI, we concentrate mainly on a
statistical approach by identifying and then excising non-Gaussian signatures,
in the sense that the extremely weak cosmic signal is actually buried under
thermal and therefore Gaussian noise. We also introduce the so-called
visibility correlation coefficient instead of conventional visibility, which
allows a further suppression of rapidly time-varying RFI. Finally, we briefly
discuss removals of the sky RFI, the leakage of sidelobes from off-field strong
radio sources with time-invariant power and a featureless spectrum. It turns
out that state of the art technique should allow us to detect and mitigate RFI
to a satisfactory level in present low frequency interferometer observations
such as those acquired with the 21CMA, and the accuracy and efficiency can be
greatly improved with the employment of low-cost, high-speed computing
facilities for data acquisition and processing.","[{'name': 'Yan Huang'}, {'name': 'Xiang-Ping Wu'}, {'name': 'Qian Zheng'}, {'name': 'Jun-Hua Gu'}, {'name': 'Haiguang Xu'}]","18 pages, 14 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06623v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-4527/16/2/036', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06623v1']",astro-ph.IM,['astro-ph.IM'],10.1088/1674-4527/16/2/036,"Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 2016, Volume 16, Issue 2,

However, even from spatially resolved regions, the observed molecules are not
necessarily arising from a single component. Disentangling multiple gas
components is often a degenerate problem in radiative transfer studies. In this
paper we investigate the use of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
approach as a means to recover gas components from a set of blended line
intensity maps of molecular transitions which may trace different physical
conditions. We run a series of experiments on synthetic datasets designed to
replicate conditions in two very different environments: galactic pre-stellar
cores and the ISM in high redshift galaxies. We find that the NMF algorithm
often recovers the multiple components resembling those used in the
data-generating process, provided that the different components have similar
column densities. When NMF fails to recover all the individual components it
does however group together the most similarly emitting ones. We further found
that initialisation and regularisation are key factors in the efficiency of the
NMF algorithm.","[{'name': 'Damien de Mijolla'}, {'name': 'Jonathan Holdship'}, {'name': 'Serena Viti'}, {'name': 'Johannes Heyl'}]","Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. 13 pages and 6

that K-type runaways must be relatively numerous. We study HD 137071, a star
that has been considered so far as a normal K-type red giant. Its parallax
measured by Gaia and the derived luminosity suggest that it is actually a
supergiant, whereas its derived distance to the galactic plane and its spatial
velocity of 54.1 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the local standard of rest suggest
that it is also a runaway star. However, intrinsic limitations in determining
the trigonometric parallaxes of cool supergiants, even in the Gaia era, require
accurate spectral classifications for confirmation. We reliably classify HD
137071 as a K4II star establishing its membership to the extreme Population I,
which is in agreement with the luminosity derived using the Gaia DR2 parallax
measurement. Kinematical data from the Gaia DR2 catalog confirm its high
spatial velocity and its runaway nature. Combining the spectral classification

evolutionary models for high-mass stars we trace the motion of HD 137071 back

2012. The antennas are connected directly to the data acquisition of the Tunka
main detector, a 1 square-km large array of 133 non-imaging photomultipliers
observing the Cherenkov light of air showers in dark and clear nights. This
allows to cross-calibrate the radio signal with the air-Cherenkov signal of the
same air showers - in particular with respect to the energy and the atmospheric
depth of the shower maximum, Xmax. Consequently, we can test whether in rural
regions with low radio background the practically achievable radio precision
comes close to the precision of the established fluorescence and air-Cherenkov
techniques. At a mid-term perspective, due to its higher duty-cycle, Tunka-Rex
can enhance the effective observing time of Tunka by an order of magnitude, at
least in the interesting energy range above 100 PeV. Moreover, Tunka-Rex is
very cost-effective, e.g., by using economic Short Aperiodic Loaded Loop
Antennas (SALLAs). Thus, the results of Tunka-Rex and the comparison to other
sophisticated radio arrays will provide crucial input for future large-scale
cosmic-ray observatories, for which measurement precision as well as costs per
area have to be optimized. In this paper we shortly describe the Tunka-Rex
setup and discuss the technical and scientific goals of Tunka-Rex.","[{'name': 'F. G. Schröder'}, {'name': 'D. Besson'}, {'name': 'N. M. Budnev'}, {'name': 'O. A. Gress'}, {'name': 'A.

  5548 from Emission-Line Variability","The narrow [O III] 4959, 5007 emission-line fluxes in the spectrum of the
well-studied Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 are shown to vary with time. From this
we show that the narrow line-emitting region has a radius of only 1-3 pc and is
denser (n ~ 10^5 cm^{-3}) than previously supposed. The [O III] line width is
consistent with virial motions at this radius given previous determinations of
the black hole mass.Since the [O III] emission-line flux is usually assumed to
be constant and is therefore used to calibrate spectroscopic monitoring data,
the variability has ramifications for the long-term secular variations of
continuum and emission-line fluxes, though it has no effect on shorter-term
reverberation studies. We present corrected optical continuum and broad Hbeta

bulge of the Galaxy is used in order to find the galactocentric distance which
better separates these two populations, from the point of view of abundances.
Statistical distance scales were used to study the distribution of abundances
across the disk-bulge interface. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to find the
distance in which the chemical properties of these regions better separate.The
results of the statistical analysis indicate that, on the average, the inner
population has lower abundances than the outer. Additionally, for the
$\alpha$-elements abundances, the inner population does not follow the disk
radial gradient towards the galactic center. Based on our results, we suggest a
bulge-disk interface at 1.5 kpc, marking the transition between the bulge and

magnified by a factor of 28 +- 8, we analyze the morphology of star formation
as traced by rest-frame ultraviolet emission, in both the highly-magnified
source plane, and in simulations of how this galaxy would appear without
lensing magnification. Were this galaxy not lensed but drawn from an HST deep
field, we would conclude that almost all its star formation arises from an
exponential disk (S\'ersic index of 1.0 +- 0.4) with an effective radius of r_e
= 2.7 +- 0.3 kpc measured from two-dimensional fitting to F606W using Galfit,
and r_e=1.9 +- 0.1 kpc measured by fitting a radial profile to F606W elliptical
isophotes. At the normal spatial resolution of the deep fields, there is no
sign of clumpy star formation within SGAS J111020.0+645950.8 . However, the
enhanced spatial resolution enabled by gravitational lensing tells a very
different story: much of the star formation arises in two dozen clumps with
sizes of r=30--50 pc spread across the 7 kpc length of the galaxy. The color
and spatial distribution of the diffuse component suggests that still smaller
clumps are unresolved. Despite this clumpy, messy morphology, the radial
profile is still well-characterized by an exponential profile. In this lensed
galaxy, stars are forming in complexes with sizes well below 100 pc; such sizes
are wholly unexplored by surveys of galaxy evolution at 1<z<3.","[{'name': 'J. R. Rigby'}, {'name': 'T. L. Johnson'}, {'name': 'K. Sharon'}, {'name': 'K. Whitaker'}, {'name': 'M. D.

coordinates were used in previous studies to seek MHD equilibria involving a
magnetic flux rope embedded in a bipolar, partially open background field. As
demonstrated by these studies, the equilibrium solutions of the system are
separated into two branches: the flux rope sticks to the photosphere for
solutions at the lower branch but is suspended in the corona for those at the
upper branch. Moreover, a solution originally at the lower branch jumps to the
upper, as the related control parameter increases and reaches a critical value,
and the associated jump is here referred to as upward catastrophe. The present
paper advances these studies in three aspects. First, the magnetic field is
changed to be force-free. The system still experiences an upward catastrophe
with an increase in each control parameter. Secondly, under the force-free
approximation, there also exists a downward catastrophe, characterized by a
jump of a solution from the upper branch to the lower. Both catastrophes are
irreversible processes connecting the two branches of equilibrium solutions so
as to form a cycle. Finally, the magnetic energy in the numerical domain is
calculated. It is found that there exists a magnetic energy release for both
catastrophes. The Amp\`{e}re's force, which vanishes everywhere for force-free
fields, appears only during the catastrophes and does a positive work, which
serves as a major mechanism for the energy release. The implications of the
downward catastrophe and its relevance to solar activities are briefly
discussed.","[{'name': 'Quanhao Zhang'}, {'name': 'Yuming Wang'}, {'name': 'Youqiu Hu'}, {'name': 'Rui Liu'}]",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02213v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/825/2/109', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02213v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.3847/0004-637X/825/2/109,"The Astrophysical Journal, 2016, Volume 825, Number 2"

tidally locked Super-Earth based on a simple greenhouse model, using Solar
System data as a guideline. These temperatures provide in combination with a
Newtonian relaxation scheme thermal forcing for a 3D atmosphere model using the
dynamical core of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology global circulation
model (MITgcm). Our model is of the same conceptional simplicity than the model
of Held & Suarez (1994) and is thus computationally fast. Furthermore, because
of the coherent, general derivation of radiative equilibrium temperatures, our
model is easily adaptable for different planets and atmospheric scenarios. As a
case study relevant for Super-Earths, we investigate a Gl581g-like planet with
Earth-like atmosphere and irradiation and present results for two
representative rotation periods of $P_{rot}$ = 10 days and $P_{rot}$ = 36.5
days. Our results provide proof of concept and highlight interesting dynamical
features for the rotating regime 3 < $P_{rot}$ < 100 days, which was shown by
Edson et al. (2011) to be an intermediate regime between equatorial
superrotation and divergence. We confirm that the $P_{rot}$ = 10 days case is
more dominated by equatorial superrotation dynamics than the $P_{rot}$ = 36.5
days case, which shows diminishing influence of standing Rossby- Kelvin waves
and increasing influence of divergence at the top of the atmosphere. We argue
that this dynamical regime change relates to the increase in Rossby deformation
radius, in agreement with previous studies. However, we also pay attention to
other features that are not or only in partial agreement with other studies,

indicating that it has little or no dark matter. Here we report the discovery
of a second galaxy in this class, residing in the same group. NGC1052-DF4
closely resembles NGC1052-DF2 in terms of its size, surface brightness, and
morphology; has a similar distance of $D=19.9\pm 2.8$ Mpc; and also has a
population of luminous globular clusters extending out to 7 kpc from the center
of the galaxy. Accurate radial velocities of the diffuse galaxy light and seven
of the globular clusters were obtained with the Low Resolution Imaging
Spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. The velocity of the diffuse light is
identical to the median velocity of the clusters, $v_{\rm sys}=\langle v_{\rm
gc} \rangle=1445$ km/s, and close to the central velocity of the NGC1052 group.
The rms spread of the observed velocities is very small at $\sigma_{\rm
obs}=5.8$ km/s. Taking observational uncertainties into account we determine an
intrinsic velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm intr}=4.2^{+4.4}_{-2.2}$ km/s,
consistent with the expected value from the stars alone ($\sigma_{\rm
stars}\approx 7$ km/s) and lower than expected from a standard NFW halo
($\sigma_{\rm halo}\sim 30$ km/s). We conclude that NGC1052-DF2 is not an
isolated case but that a class of such objects exists. The origin of these
large, faint galaxies with an excess of luminous globular clusters and an
apparent lack of dark matter is, at present, not understood.","[{'name': 'Pieter van Dokkum'}, {'name': 'Shany Danieli'}, {'name': 'Roberto Abraham'}, {'name': 'Charlie Conroy'}, {'name': 'Aaron J. Romanowsky'}]","ApJ Letters, in press. The revised version has a new figure and an

  Science goals, sample selection and analysis tools","(Abridged) AVOCADO aims at establishing firm conclusions on the formation and
evolution of dwarf galaxies by constructing and analysing a homogeneous,
multiwavelength dataset for a statistically significant sample of approximately
6500 nearby dwarfs (M_i > -18 mag). We present the sample selection criteria
and describe the suite of analysis tools, some of them developed in the
framework of the Virtual Observatory. We make use of optical spectra and
UV-to-NIR imaging of the dwarf sample to derive SFRs, stellar masses, ages and
metallicities - which are further supplemented with structural parameters that
are used to classify them morphologically. This dataset, coupled with a
detailed characterisation of each dwarf's environment, allows for a fully
comprehensive investigation of their origins and to track the potential
evolutionary paths between the different dwarf types. We characterise the local
environment of all dwarfs in our sample, paying special attention to trends
with current star formation activity. We find that virtually all quiescent
dwarfs are located in the vicinity (projected distances < 1.5 Mpc) of L*
companions, consistent with recent results. While star-forming dwarfs are
preferentially found at separations of the order of 1 Mpc, there appears to be
a tail towards low separations (<100 kpc) in the distribution of projected
distances. We speculate that, modulo projection effects, this probably
represents a genuine population of late-type dwarfs caught upon first infall
about their host and before environmental quenching has fully operated. In this
context, these results suggest that internal mechanisms -such as gas exhaustion
via star formation or feedback effects- are not sufficient to completely cease
the star formation activity in dwarf galaxies, and that becoming the satellite
of a massive central galaxy appears to be a necessary condition to create a
quiescent dwarf.","[{'name': 'R. Sánchez-Janssen'}, {'name': 'R. Amorín'}, {'name': 'M. García-Vargas'}, {'name': 'J. M. Gomes'}, {'name': 'M. Huertas-Company'}, {'name': 'F.

many cases with substantial peak-to-valley contrast. The DSHARP campaign shows
that several of these rings are very narrow in radial extent. In this paper we
test the hypothesis that these dust rings are caused by dust trapping in radial
pressure bumps, and if confirmed, put constraints on the physics of the dust
trapping mechanism. We model this process analytically in 1D, assuming
axisymmetry. By comparing this model to the data, we find that all rings are
consistent with dust trapping. Based on a plausible model of the dust
temperature we find that several rings are narrower than the pressure scale
height, providing strong evidence for dust trapping. The rings have peak
absorption optical depth in the range between 0.2 and 0.5. The dust masses
stored in each of these rings is of the order of tens of Earth masses, though
much ambiguity remains due to the uncertainty of the dust opacities. The dust
rings are dense enough to potentially trigger the streaming instability, but
our analysis cannot give proof of this mechanism actually operating. Our
results show, however, that the combination of very low alpha_turb << 5e-4 and
very large grains a_grain >> 0.1 cm can be excluded by the data for all the
rings studied in this paper.","[{'name': 'Cornelis P. Dullemond'}, {'name': 'Tilman Birnstiel'}, {'name': 'Jane Huang'}, {'name': 'Nicolás T. Kurtovic'}, {'name': 'Sean M.

  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. As constrained by the Permittivity Probe
  SESAME-PP/Philae/Rosetta","Context. Comets are primitive objects, remnants of the volatile-rich
planetesimals from which the solar system condensed. Knowing their structure
and composition is thus crucial for the understanding of our origins. After the
successful landing of Philae on the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in
November 2014, for the first time, the Rosetta mission provided the opportunity
to measure the low frequency electrical properties of a cometary mantle with
the permittivity probe SESAME-PP (Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic
Monitoring Experiment - Permittivity Probe).
  Aims. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the data from active
measurements collected by SESAME-PP at Abydos, which is the final landing site
of Philae, to constrain the porosity and, to a lesser extent, the composition
of the surface material down to a depth of about 1 meter.
  Methods. SESAME-PP observations on the surface are then analyzed by
comparison with data acquired during the descent toward the nucleus and with
numerical simulations that explore different possible attitudes and
environments of Philae at Abydos using a method called the Capacity-Influence
Matrix Method.
  Results. Reasonably assuming that the two receiving electrode channels have
not drifted with respect to each other during the ten-year journey of the
Rosetta probe to the comet, we constrain the dielectric constant of the first
meter below the surface at Abydos to be > 2.45 p/m 0.20, which is consistent
with a porosity < 50% if the dust phase is analogous to carbonaceous chondrites
and < 75% in the case of less primitive ordinary chondrites. This indicates
that the near surface of the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus is
more compacted than its interior and suggests that it could consist of a
sintered dust-ice layer.","[{'name': 'Anthony Lethuillier'}, {'name': 'Alice Le Gall'}, {'name': 'Michel Hamelin'}, {'name': 'Walter Schmidt'}, {'name': 'Klaus J.

  Interstellar Organic Residues with Ultraviolet Irradiation","Refractory organic compounds formed in molecular clouds are among the
building blocks of the solar system objects and could be the precursors of
organic matter found in primitive meteorites and cometary materials. However,
little is known about the evolutionary pathways of molecular cloud organics
from dense molecular clouds to planetary systems. In this study, we focus on
the evolution of the morphological and viscoelastic properties of molecular
cloud refractory organic matter. We found that the organic residue,
experimentally synthesized at about 10 K from UV-irradiated H2O-CH3OH-NH3 ice,
changed significantly in terms of its nanometer- to micrometer-scale morphology
and viscoelastic properties after UV irradiation at room temperature. The dose
of this irradiation was equivalent to that experienced after short residence in
diffuse clouds (equal or less than 10,000 years) or irradiation in outer
protoplanetary disks. The irradiated organic residues became highly porous and
more rigid and formed amorphous nanospherules. These nanospherules are
morphologically similar to organic nanoglobules observed in the least-altered
chondrites, chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles, and cometary
samples, suggesting that irradiation of refractory organics could be a possible
formation pathway for such nanoglobules. The storage modulus (elasticity) of
photo-irradiated organic residues is about 100 MPa irrespective of vibrational
frequency, a value that is lower than the storage moduli of minerals and ice.
Dust grains coated with such irradiated organics would therefore stick together
efficiently, but growth to larger grains might be suppressed due to an increase
in aggregate brittleness caused by the strong connections between grains.","[{'name': 'Laurette Piani'}, {'name': 'Shogo Tachibana'}, {'name': 'Tetsuya Hama'}, {'name': 'Hidekazu Tanaka'}, {'name': 'Yukiko Endo'}, {'name': 'Iyo Sugawara'}, {'name': 'Lucile Dessimoulie'}, {'name': 'Yuki Kimura'}, {'name': 'Akira Miyake'}, {'name': 'Junya Matsuno'}, {'name': 'Akira Tsuchiyama'}, {'name': 'Kazuyuki Fujita'}, {'name': 'Shunichi Nakatsubo'}, {'name': 'Hiroki Fukushi'}, {'name': 'Shoichi Mori'}, {'name': 'Takeshi Chigai'}, {'name': 'Hisayoshi Yurimoto'}, {'name': 'Akira Kouchi'}]","11 pages, 8 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00613v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aa5ca6', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00613v1']",astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],10.3847/1538-4357/aa5ca6,"The Astrophysical Journal, 837:35 (11pp), 2017 March 1"

wavelength range using FORCAST and HAWC+ onboard SOFIA. Using these
observations, high-angular resolution infrared (IR) and sub-mm observations, we
find an observational turn-over of the torus emission in the $30-40$ $\mu$m
wavelength range with a characteristic temperature of $70-100$ K. This
component is clearly different from the diffuse extended emission in the narrow
line and star formation regions at 10-100 $\mu$m within the central 700 pc. We
compute $2.2-432$ $\mu$m 2D images using the best inferred \textsc{clumpy}
torus model based on several nuclear spectral energy distribution (SED)
coverages. We find that when $1-20$ $\mu$m SED is used, the inferred result
gives a small torus size ($<4$ pc radius) and a steep radial dust distribution.
The computed torus using the $1-432$ $\mu$m SED provides comparable torus
sizes, $5.1^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ pc radius, and morphology to the recently resolved
432 $\mu$m ALMA observations. This result indicates that the $1-20$ $\mu$m
wavelength range is not able to probe the full extent of the torus. The
characterization of the turn-over emission of the torus using the $30-60$
$\mu$m wavelength range is sensitive to the detection of cold dust in the
torus. The morphology of the dust emission in our 2D image at 432 $\mu$m is
spatially coincident with the cloud distribution, while the morphology of the
emission in the $1-20$ $\mu$m wavelength range shows an elongated morphology
perpendicular to the cloud distribution. We find that our 2D \textsc{clumpy}
torus image at 12 $\mu$m can produce comparable results to those observed using
IR interferometry.","[{'name': 'Enrique Lopez-Rodriguez'}, {'name': 'Lindsay Fuller'}, {'name': 'Almudena Alonso-Herrero'}, {'name': 'Andreas Efstathiou'}, {'name': 'Kohei Ichikawa'}, {'name': 'Nancy A.

  and their Environmental Dependence","The internal distribution of heavy elements, in particular the radial
metallicity gradient, offers insight into the merging history of galaxies.
Using our cosmological, chemodynamical simulations that include both detailed
chemical enrichment and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), we find
that stellar metallicity gradients in the most massive galaxies
($\sim3\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$) are made flatter by mergers and are unable to
regenerate due to the quenching of star formation by AGN feedback. The fitting
range is chosen on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis in order to mask satellite
galaxies. The evolutionary paths of the gradients can be summarised as follows;
i) creation of initial steep gradients by gas-rich assembly, ii) passive
evolution by star formation and/or stellar accretion at outskirts, iii) sudden
flattening by mergers. There is a significant scatter in gradients at a given
mass, which originates from the last path, and therefore from galaxy type. Some
variation remains at given galaxy mass and type because of the complexity of
merging events, and hence we find only a weak environmental dependence. Our
early-type galaxies (ETGs), defined from the star formation main sequence
rather than their morphology, are in excellent agreement with the observed
stellar metallicity gradients of ETGs in the SAURON and ATLAS3D surveys. We
find small positive [O/Fe] gradients of stars in our simulated galaxies,
although they are smaller with AGN feedback. Gas-phase metallicity and [O/Fe]
gradients also show variation, the origin of which is not as clear as for
stellar populations.","[{'name': 'Philip Taylor'}, {'name': 'Chiaki Kobayashi'}]","Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 18 pages, 16 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06488v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx1860', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06488v1']",astro-ph.GA,['astro-ph.GA'],10.1093/mnras/stx1860,

  binary systems: methodology for testing and comparison","The problem of reconstructing the sky position of compact binary coalescences
detected via gravitational waves is a central one for future observations with
the ground-based network of gravitational-wave laser interferometers, such as
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Different techniques for sky localisation
have been independently developed. They can be divided in two broad categories:
fully coherent Bayesian techniques, which are high-latency and aimed at
in-depth studies of all the parameters of a source, including sky position, and
""triangulation-based"" techniques, which exploit the data products from the
search stage of the analysis to provide an almost real-time approximation of
the posterior probability density function of the sky location of a detection
candidate. These techniques have previously been applied to data collected
during the last science runs of gravitational-wave detectors operating in the
so-called initial configuration.
  Here, we develop and analyse methods for assessing the self-consistency of
parameter estimation methods and carrying out fair comparisons between
different algorithms, addressing issues of efficiency and optimality. These
methods are general, and can be applied to parameter estimation problems other
than sky localisation. We apply these methods to two existing sky localisation
techniques representing the two above-mentioned categories, using a set of
simulated inspiral-only signals from compact binary systems with total mass
$\le 20\,M_\odot$ and non-spinning components. We compare the relative
advantages and costs of the two techniques and show that sky location
uncertainties are on average a factor $\approx 20$ smaller for fully coherent
techniques than for the specific variant of the ""triangulation-based"" technique
used during the last science runs, at the expense of a factor $\approx 1000$
longer processing time.","[{'name': 'Trevor Sidery'}, {'name': 'Ben Aylott'}, {'name': 'Nelson Christensen'}, {'name': 'Ben Farr'}, {'name': 'Will Farr'}, {'name': 'Farhan Feroz'}, {'name': 'Jonathan Gair'}, {'name': 'Katherine Grover'}, {'name': 'Philip Graff'}, {'name': 'Chad Hanna'}, {'name': 'Vassiliki Kalogera'}, {'name': 'Ilya Mandel'}, {'name': ""Richard O'Shaughnessy""}, {'name': 'Matthew Pitkin'}, {'name': 'Larry Price'}, {'name': 'Vivien Raymond'}, {'name': 'Christian Roever'}, {'name': 'Leo Singer'}, {'name': 'Marc Van der Sluys'}, {'name': 'Rory J.

We will work using the phenomenological MIT Bag model. The stability of the

magnetic field and the Bag parameter. Results obtained were compared with those
of magnetized normal quark matter (only u and d quarks in beta equilibrium) as
well as the Strange Quark Matter (SQM). It is found that the energy per baryon
decreases with the increasing magnetic field which implies that the MSQM is
more stable than SQM. The Equations of State previously obtained are used to
obtain stable configurations of magnetized strange stars checking that the

optical properties of the planet clouds contained in the measured phase curve.
We generate cloud maps of Kepler-7b and use a multiple-scattering approach to
create synthetic phase curves, thus connecting postulated clouds with

composition and size of the cloud particles. Indeed, model fitting for
Kepler-7b requires poorly absorbing particles that scatter with low-to-moderate
anisotropic efficiency, conclusions consistent with condensates of silicates,
perovskite, and silica of submicron radii. We also show that we are limited in
our ability to pin down the extent and location of the clouds. These
considerations are relevant to the interpretation of optical phase curves with

analyses show that methyl carbamate is more stable isomer than glycine. Because
of this, there could be a higher chance for methyl carbamte to exist in the
interstellar medium as compared to glycine. Despite immense searches, till now
glycine has not been detected in the ISM, therefore it is worthwhile to search
its isomer methyl carbamate. In this paper, we present the constraints of
methyl carbamate formation under the interstellar conditions. Large complex
organic molecules are favorably produced in hot-corino environments of low mass
protostars. We for the first time carried out astrochemical modeling focusing
on the formation of methyl carbamate in physical conditions similar to
hot-corino objects. Consequently, we examined ALMA archival data for existing
spectral line observations toward hot corinos NGC1333 IRAS 4A2 and IRAS 16293B.
Within the common spectral range towards these sources, we found three features
are possibly related to the spectral transitions of methyl carbamate and
consequently estimate the upper limit of column densities. Results of chemical
modeling are consistent with the observational upper limit of estimated column
density/abundance toward the sources. This may hint the validation of the
proposed formation mechanism. Future observations using telescope like ngVLA
may confirm the presence of MC toward the hot corinos.","[{'name': 'Dipen Sahu'}, {'name': 'Sheng-Yuan Liu'}, {'name': 'Ankan Das'}, {'name': 'Prasanta Gorai'}, {'name': 'Valentine Wakelam'}]",Accepted for publication in ApJ,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15629v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aba0a5', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15629v1']",astro-ph.GA,['astro-ph.GA'],10.3847/1538-4357/aba0a5,

analysis, we find self-absorbed 12CO J=3-2 profiles, which are typical in star
forming regions, but we do not find any evidence of outflow activity. Moreover,
we do not detect either HCO+ J=4-3 or CS J=7-6 in the region, which are species
normally enhanced in molecular outflows and high density envelopes. The 12CO
J=3-2 emission profile suggests the presence of expanding gas in the region.

emission bright at 8 um with an evident shell-like morphology of ~ 1.5 arcmin

  stars. III. Comparison of amplitude spectrum fitting and Gaussian process
  regression using celerite2","Studies of massive stars using space photometry have revealed that they
commonly exhibit stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability. This has been
interpreted as being caused by internal gravity waves (IGWs) excited at the
interface of convective and radiative regions within stellar interiors, such as
the convective core or sub-surface convection zones. We aim to compare the
properties of SLF variability in massive main-sequence stars observed by the
TESS mission determined by different statistical methods, and confirm the
correlation between the morphology of SLF variability and a star's location in
the HR diagram. From a sample of 30 massive stars observed by TESS, we compare
the resultant parameters of SLF variability, in particular the characteristic
frequency, obtained from fitting the amplitude spectrum of the light curve with
those inferred from fitting the covariance structure of the light curve using
the celerite2 Gaussian process (GP) regression software and a damped SHO
kernel. We find a difference in the characteristic frequency obtained from the
amplitude spectrum fitting and from fitting the co-variance structure of the
light curve using a GP regression with celerite2 for only a minority of the
considered sample. However, the trends among mass, age and the properties of
SLF variability previously reported remain unaffected. GP regression is a
useful and novel methodology to efficiently characterise SLF variability in
massive stars compared to previous techniques used in the literature. We
conclude that the correlation between a star's SLF variability, in particular
the characteristic frequency, and its location in the HR diagram is robust for
main-sequence massive stars. There also exists a distribution in the
stochasticity of SLF variability in massive stars, which indicates that the
coherency of SLF variability is also a function of mass and age in massive
stars.","[{'name': 'Dominic M. Bowman'}, {'name': 'Trevor Z.

  star","Aim: To study the multimessenger nature of the signal that can result from
the phase transition of a neutron star to a quark star and their corresponding
astrophysical observations. Methods: The phase transition process is initiated
by the abrupt pressure and density changes at the star center, giving rise to a
shock which deconfines matter followed by a weak front converting excess down
to strange quarks to attain absolute stability. This process's effects are
investigated by understanding how the energy escapes from the star in the form
of neutrino-antineutrino annihilation. For such annihilation process, the
corresponding energy deposition rate is calculated. Structural changes due to
the energy loss have been investigated in the likes of misalignment angle
evolution of the star and its astrophysical observation through gravitational
waves. Results: The energy and time signature for the neutrino-antineutrino
annihilation is compared with the observed isotropic energy for a short
gamma-ray burst. The misalignment angle evolves to align the star's tilt axis,
which can lead to the sudden increase or decrease of radio intensity from the
pulsar. The corresponding gravitational wave emission, both continuous and
burst, all lead towards multimessenger signals coming from the phase
transition.","[{'name': 'Debojoti Kuzur'}, {'name': 'Ritam Mallick'}, {'name': 'Prasad R'}, {'name': 'Shailendra Singh'}]","9 pages, 7 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00422v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.105.065807', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00422v1']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.1103/PhysRevC.105.065807,"Phys.

Galactic globular clusters (GC) in g and z, as well as r and i photometry for a
subset of 60 GCs and u photometry for 22 GCs, to determine the structural
parameters assuming King (1962) models.
  In general, the resulting core radii are in good comparison with the current
literature values. However, our half-light radii are slightly lower than the
literature. The concentrations (and therefore also the tidal radii) are poorly
constrained mostly because of the limited radial extent of our imaging.
Therefore, we extensively discuss the effects of a limited field-of-view on the
derived parameters using mosaicked SDSS data, which do not suffer from this
restriction. We also illustrate how red giant branch (RGB) stars in cluster
cores can stochastically induce artificial peaks in the surface brightness
profiles. The issues related to these bright stars are scrutinised based on
both our photometry and simulated clusters. We also examine colour gradients
and find that the strongest central colour gradients are caused by central RGB
stars and thus not representative for the cluster light or colour distribution.
  We recover the known relation between the half-light radius and the
Galactocentric distance in the g-band, but find a lower slope for redder
filters. We did not find a correlation between the scatter on this relation and
other cluster properties. We find tentative evidence for a correlation between
the half-light radii and the [Fe/H], with metal-poor GCs being larger than
metal-rich GCs. However, we conclude that this trend is caused by the position
of the clusters in the Galaxy, with metal-rich clusters being more centrally
located.","[{'name': 'Joachim Vanderbeke'}, {'name': 'Roberto De Propris'}, {'name': 'Sven De Rijcke'}, {'name': 'Maarten Baes'}, {'name': 'Michael J. West'}, {'name': 'John P. Blakeslee'}]","17 pages, 23 figures, 3 tables. Accepted to MNRAS. The online

non-minimally to gravity via $\xi_I(\phi^I)^n g^{\mu\nu}R_{\mu\nu}$, where
$\xi_I$ are coupling constants, $\phi^I$ the fields driving inflation,
$g_{\mu\nu}$ the space-time metric, $R_{\mu\nu}$ the Ricci tensor, and $n>0$.
We consider the so-called $\alpha$-attractor models in two formulations of
gravity: in the usual metric case where $R_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu}(g_{\mu\nu})$,
and in the Palatini formulation where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is an independent variable.
As the main result, we show that, regardless of the underlying theory of
gravity, the field-space curvature in the Einstein frame has no influence on
the inflationary dynamics at the limit of large $\xi_I$, and one effectively
retains the single-field case. However, the gravity formulation does play an
important role: in the metric case the result means that multifield models
approach the single-field $\alpha$-attractor limit, whereas in the Palatini
case the attractor behaviour is lost also in the case of multifield inflation.
We discuss what this means for distinguishing between different models of
inflation.","[{'name': 'Pedro Carrilho'}, {'name': 'David Mulryne'}, {'name': 'John Ronayne'}, {'name': 'Tommi Tenkanen'}]","20 pages, 6 figures. Typos corrected and references added. This is an

  Black Hole","Observational studies of nearby galaxies have demonstrated correlations
between the mass of the central supermassive black holes (BHs) and properties
of the host galaxies, notably the stellar bulge mass or central stellar
velocity dispersion. Motivated by these correlations, the theoretical paradigm
has emerged, in which BHs and bulges co-evolve. However, this picture was
challenged by observational and theoretical studies, which hinted that the
fundamental connection may be between BHs and dark matter halos, and not
necessarily with their host galaxies. Based on a study of 3130 elliptical
galaxies $-$ selected from the Sloan Digital and ROSAT All Sky Surveys $-$ we
demonstrate that the central stellar velocity dispersion exhibits a
significantly tighter correlation with the total gravitating mass, traced by
the X-ray luminosity of the hot gas, than with the stellar mass. This hints
that the central stellar velocity dispersion, and hence the central
gravitational potential, may be the fundamental property of elliptical galaxies
that is most tightly connected to the larger-scale dark matter halo.
Furthermore, using the central stellar velocity dispersion as a surrogate for
the BH mass, we find that in elliptical galaxies the inferred BH mass and
inferred total gravitating mass within the virial radius (or within five
effective radii) can be expressed as $M_{\rm{BH}} \propto M_{\rm
tot}^{1.6^{+0.6}_{-0.4}} $ (or $M_{\rm{BH}} \propto
M_{\rm{5r_{eff}}}^{1.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6}}$). These results are consistent with a
picture in which the BH mass is directly set by the central stellar velocity
dispersion, which, in turn, is determined by the total gravitating mass of the
system.","[{'name': 'Akos Bogdan'}, {'name': 'Andy D.

supercritical accretion onto compact objects. One of the key questions
regarding these objects is whether or not the hard X-rays are geometrically
beamed toward the symmetric axis. We propose to test the scenario using disk
irradiation, to see how much the outer accretion disk sees the central hard
X-rays. We collect a sample of 11 bright ULXs with an identification of a
unique optical counterpart, and model their optical fluxes considering two
irradiating sources: soft X-rays from the photosphere of the optically thick
wind driven by supercritical accretion, and if needed in addition, hard X-rays
from the Comptonization component. Our results indicate that the soft X-ray
irradiation can account for the optical emission in the majority of ULXs, and
the fraction of hard X-rays reprocessed on the outer disk is constrained to be
no more than $\sim$$10^{-2}$ in general. Such an upper limit is well consistent
with the irradiation fraction expected in the case of no beaming. Therefore, no
stringent constraint on the beaming effect can be placed according to the
current data quality.","[{'name': 'Yanli Qiu'}, {'name': 'Hua Feng'}]",accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02237v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3569', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02237v1']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.3847/1538-4357/ac3569,

nearby faint object are co-moving and to measure the infrared colors of both
objects. We obtained optical and infrared spectra of both objects with the VLT

faint nearby object have a projected separation of 1369.58 mas, i.e. 178 AU at
130 pc. They share the same proper motion (~5 sigma), so that they most

strong emission lines in [MR81] Ha 17 NE, which are almost certainly due to
ongoing accretion. The NE object is detectable only by means of its scattered
light. If both objects are coeval (2-3 Myr) and located at the same distance

the metallicity. In this Letter, we have measured the rest-frame NUV-B color
gradients in ~1400 large ($\rm r_e>0.18^{\prime\prime}$), nearly face-on

origin of UV-optical color gradients in the SFGs at z~1 and discuss their link
with the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally
compact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more
negative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally
diffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on
optical-SED fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass ($M_{\ast}
<10^{10}M_{\odot}$) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the
high-mass ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$) SFGs still retain shallow negative
color gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the
principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both
increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely
the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings
also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar
masses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.","[{'name': 'F. S. Liu'}, {'name': 'Dongfei Jiang'}, {'name': 'Yicheng Guo'}, {'name': 'David C. Koo'}, {'name': 'S. M.

(SN) explosions, artificially generated by driving a piston at the base of the
envelope of a rotating or non-rotating red-supergiant progenitor star. We
search for trends in ejecta kinematics in the resulting Type II-Plateau (II-P)
SN, exploring dependencies with explosion energy and pre-SN stellar-evolution
model. We recover the trivial result that larger explosion energies yield
larger ejecta velocities in a given progenitor. However, we emphasise that for
a given explosion energy, the increasing helium-core mass with main-sequence
mass of such Type II-P SN progenitors leads to ejection of core-embedded
oxygen-rich material at larger velocities. We find that the photospheric
velocity at 15d after shock breakout is a good and simple indicator of the
explosion energy in our selected set of pre-SN models. This measurement,
combined with the width of the nebular-phase OI6303-6363A line, can be used to
place an upper-limit on the progenitor main-sequence mass. Using the results
from our simulations, we find that the current, but remarkably scant, late-time
spectra of Type II-P SNe support progenitor main-sequence masses inferior to
~20Msun and thus, corroborate the inferences based on the direct, but
difficult, progenitor identification in pre-explosion images. The narrow width
of OI6303-6363A in Type II-P SNe with nebular spectra does not support
high-mass progenitors in the range 25-30Msun. Combined with quantitative
spectroscopic modelling, such diagnostics offer a means to constrain the
main-sequence mass of the progenitor, the mass fraction of the core ejected,
and thus, the mass of the compact remnant formed.","[{'name': 'Luc Dessart'}, {'name': 'Eli Livne'}, {'name': 'Roni Waldman'}]",accepted to MNRAS,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2268v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17190.x', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.2268v1']",astro-ph.SR,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.HE']",10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17190.x,

M_sun mass halo extracted from a simulation consistent with the concordance
cosmology, where the physics regulating the transformation of gas into stars
was allowed to change producing galaxies with different morphologies. The
presence of baryons produces the concentration of the DM halo with respect to
its corresponding dissipationless run, but we found that this response does not
only depend on the amount of baryons gathered in the central region but also on
the way they have been assembled. DM and baryons affect each other in a complex
way so the formation history of a galaxy plays an important role on its final
total mass distribution. Supernova (SN) feedback regulates the star formation
and triggers galactic outflows not only in the central galaxy but also in its
satellites. Our results suggest that, as the effects of SN feedback get
stronger, satellites get less massive and can even be more easily disrupted by
dynamical friction, transferring less angular momentum. We found indications
that this angular momentum could be acquired not only by the outer part of the
DM halo but also by the inner ones and by the stellar component in the central
galaxy. The latter effect produces stellar migration which contributes to
change the inner potential well, probably working against further DM
contraction. As a consequence of the action of these processes, when the halo
hosts a galaxy with an important disc structure formed by smooth gas accretion,
it is more concentrated than when it hosts a spheroidal system which
experienced more massive mergers and interactions. (abridged)","[{'name': 'Susana E. Pedrosa', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Astronomy and Space Physics - Argentina'}, {'name': 'Patricia B.

of the cosmic ray particles at lower energies must be produced and released in

  misaligned inner disk","While planet formation is thought to occur early in the history of a
protoplanetary disk, the presence of planets embedded in disks, or of other
processes driving disk evolution, might be traced from their imprints on the
disk structure. We observed the T Tauri star HD 143006, located in the 5-11
Myr-old Upper Sco region, in polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE at
near-infrared wavelengths, reaching an angular resolution of ~0.037"" (~6 au).
We obtained two datasets, one with a 145 mas diameter coronagraph, and the
other without, enabling us to probe the disk structure down to an angular
separation of ~0.06"" (~10 au). In our observations, the disk of HD 143006 is
clearly resolved up to ~0.5"" and shows a clear large-scale asymmetry with the
eastern side brighter than the western side. We detect a number of additional
features, including two gaps and a ring. The ring shows an overbrightness at a
position angle (PA) of ~140 deg, extending over a range in position angle of
~60 deg, and two narrow dark regions. The two narrow dark lanes and the overall
large-scale asymmetry are indicative of shadowing effects, likely due to a
misaligned inner disk. We demonstrate the remarkable resemblance between the
scattered light image of HD 143006 and a model prediction of a warped disk due
to an inclined binary companion. The warped disk model, based on the
hydrodynamic simulations combined with 3D radiative transfer calculations,
reproduces all major morphological features. However, it does not account for
the observed overbrightness at PA~140 deg. Shadows have been detected in
several protoplanetary disks, suggesting that misalignment in disks is not
uncommon. However, the origin of the misalignment is not clear.
As-yet-undetected stellar or massive planetary companions could be responsible
for them, and naturally account for the presence of depleted inner cavities.","[{'name': 'M. Benisty'}, {'name': 'A. Juhasz'}, {'name': 'S. Facchini'}, {'name': 'P.

scientific activities (e.g., invitations to join collaborations, proposal
selections, grant allocations, publication review processes, and invitations to
attend and speak at conferences) to activities more strictly related to career
advancement (e.g., reference letters, fellowships, hiring, promotion, and

excellence, as the most diverse talents encounter bigger challenges and
difficulties to reach the same milestones than their more privileged

(STScI) has constructed tools to raise awareness of (un)conscious bias and has
designed guidelines and goals to increase diversity representation and outcome
in its scientific activities, including career-related matters and STScI
sponsored fellowships, conferences, workshops, and colloquia. STScI has also
addressed (un)conscious bias in the peer-review process by anonymizing
submission and evaluation of Hubble Space Telescope (and soon to be James Webb

collisionally and through disruptions due to rapid rotation [1]. These
processes can lead to the formation of binary asteroids [2-4] and to the
release of dust [5], both directly and, in some cases, through uncovering
frozen volatiles. In a sub-set of the asteroids called main-belt comets (MBCs),
the sublimation of excavated volatiles causes transient comet-like activity
[6-8]. Torques exerted by sublimation measurably influence the spin rates of
active comets [9] and might lead to the splitting of bilobate comet nuclei
[10]. The kilometer-sized main-belt asteroid 288P (300163) showed activity for
several months around its perihelion 2011 [11], suspected to be sustained by
the sublimation of water ice [12] and supported by rapid rotation [13], while
at least one component rotates slowly with a period of 16 hours [14]. 288P is
part of a young family of at least 11 asteroids that formed from a ~10km
diameter precursor during a shattering collision 7.5 million years ago [15].
Here we report that 288P is a binary main-belt comet. It is different from the
known asteroid binaries for its combination of wide separation, near-equal
component size, high eccentricity, and comet-like activity. The observations
also provide strong support for sublimation as the driver of activity in 288P
and show that sublimation torques may play a significant role in binary orbit
evolution.","[{'name': 'Jessica Agarwal'}, {'name': 'David Jewitt'}, {'name': 'Max Mutchler'}, {'name': 'Harold Weaver'}, {'name': 'Stephen Larson'}]","18 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables",http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03454v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23892', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03454v1']",astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],10.1038/nature23892,"Nature 549, pp. 357-359 (2017)"

750M$_\odot{}$ per minihalo, corresponding to a star formation efficiency of
0.1%. Further, it is important to include baryon-dark matter streaming

they include $\sim$70 outflow troughs from ionic transitions. These include the
first non-solar detections from transitions of O V*, Ne V*, Ar VI, Ca VI, Ca

VIII, Na IX, and Mg X) in all outflows necessitates at least two-ionization
phases for the observed outflows. We develop an interactive Synthetic Spectral
Simulation method to fit the multitude of observed troughs. Detections of
density sensitive troughs (e.g., S IV* $\lambda$ 657.32 $\r{A}$ and the O V*
multiplet) allow us to determine the distance of the outflows ($R$) as well as
their energetics. Two of the outflows are at $R$ $\simeq$ 800 pc and one is at

report the discovery of a faint stellar companion to the A3V star zeta
Virginis. This companion is ~7 magnitudes fainter than its host star in the
H-band, and infrared imaging spanning 4.75 years over five epochs indicates
this companion has common proper motion with its host star. Using evolutionary
models, we estimate its mass to be 0.168+/-.016 solar masses, giving a mass
ratio for this system q = 0.082. Assuming the two objects are coeval, this mass
suggests a M4V-M7V spectral type for the companion, which is confirmed through
integral field spectroscopic measurements. We see clear evidence for orbital
motion from this companion and are able to constrain the semi-major axis to be
greater than 24.9 AU, the period > 124$ yrs, and eccentricity > 0.16.
Multiplicity studies of higher mass stars are relatively rare, and binary
companions such as this one at the extreme low end of the mass ratio
distribution are useful additions to surveys incomplete at such a low mass
ratio. Moreover, the frequency of binary companions can help to discriminate
between binary formation scenarios that predict an abundance of low-mass
companions forming from the early fragmentation of a massive circumstellar
disk. A system such as this may provide insight into the anomalous X-ray
emission from A stars, hypothesized to be from unseen late-type stellar
companions. Indeed, we calculate that the presence of this M-dwarf companion

their research it is very important to use a sufficient sensitivity of antenna
systems. In this paper we study an influence of the radiotelescope-antenna
effective area on the results of decameter solar radio observations. For this

dipoles and the single dipole of the radiotelescope UTR-2. It's shown that a
larger effective area of the ground-based antenna allows us to measure a weaker

tests possible for Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Spitzer 3.6 micron
photometry fixes the bulge parameterisation and strongly constrains the
properties of the sub-dominant stellar disk. Furthermore, the distance is known
to better than 5 percent, virtually eliminating it as a free parameter. The
rotation curve is easily measured, since the H I (and stellar) disks are edge
on, and both the receding and approaching sides agree very well. In this paper
we explore the agreement between the model and observed rotation curves in MOND
given that the only two free parameters available are the mass-to-light ratios
of the bulge and disk. We use a grid based MOND Poisson solver that accurately
solves for the MOND gravity and produces our model rotation curves from a given
mass distribution. The input to the Poisson solver is a 3D distribution of N
particles which is generated from modelling the observed distribution of stars
and gas in the galaxy. By ensuring a superior fit to the radial surface
brightness profile than previous works, by virtue of a double Sersic fit to the
bulge, we were able to produce excellent fits to the rotation curve with
typical values for both mass-to-light ratios. We conclude that the model
rotation curve of a mass distribution in MOND is extremely sensitive to the
bulge-disk decomposition and even slight deviation from the observed mass
distribution can produce large differences in the model rotation curve.","[{'name': 'Garry W.

Galaxy and across the Universe - in many respects. They populate disks and
spheroids of galaxies as well as almost every galactic center. In massive
elliptical galaxies nuclear clusters harbor supermassive black holes, which
might influence the evolution of their host galaxies as a whole. The evolution
of dense star clusters is not only governed by the aging of their stellar
populations and simple Newtonian dynamics. For increasing particle number,
unique gravitational effects of collisional many-body systems begin to dominate
the early cluster evolution. As a result, stellar densities become so high that
stars can interact and collide, stellar evolution and binary stars change the
dynamical evolution, black holes can accumulate in their centers and merge with
relativistic effects becoming important. Recent high-resolution imaging has
revealed even more complex structural properties with respect to stellar
populations, binary fractions and compact objects as well as - the still
controversial - existence of intermediate mass black holes in clusters of
intermediate mass. Dense star clusters therefore are the ideal laboratory for
the concomitant study of stellar evolution and Newtonian as well as
relativistic dynamics. Not only the formation and disruption of dense star
clusters has to be considered but also their galactic environments in terms of
initial conditions as well as their impact on galactic evolution. This review

  Period--Luminosity--Metallicity Relations","We present new theoretical period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations for
RR Lyrae stars (RRL) at Spitzer and WISE wavelengths. The PLZ relations were
derived using nonlinear, time-dependent convective hydrodynamical models for a
broad range in metal abundances (Z=0.0001 to 0.0198). In deriving the light
curves, we tested two sets of atmospheric models (Brott & Hauschildt 2005,
Castelli & Kurucz 2003) and found no significant difference between the
resulting mean magnitudes. We also compare our theoretical relations to
empirical relations derived from RRL in both the field and in the globular
cluster M4. Our theoretical PLZ relations were combined with multi-wavelength
observations to simultaneously fit the distance modulus, mu_0, and extinction,
Av, of both the individual Galactic RRL and of the cluster M4. The results for
the Galactic RRL are consistent with trigonometric parallax measurements from
Gaia's first data release. For M4, we find a distance modulus of $\mu_0=11.257
\pm 0.035$ mag with $A_V = 1.45 \pm 0.12$ mag, which is consistent with
measurements from other distance indicators. This analysis has shown that when
considering a sample covering a range of iron abundances, the metallicity
spread introduces a dispersion in the PL relation on the order of 0.13 mag.
However, if this metallicity component is accounted for in a PLZ relation, the
dispersion is reduced to ~0.02 mag at MIR wavelengths.","[{'name': 'Jillian R. Neeley'}, {'name': 'Massimo Marengo'}, {'name': 'Giuseppe Bono'}, {'name': 'Vittorio F.

  J1802-2124","The intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs) are characterized by relatively
long spin periods (10 - 200 ms) and massive ($\ga 0.4 M_{\odot}$) white dwarf
(WD) companions. Recently, precise mass measurements have been performed for
the pulsar and the WD in the IMBP PSR J1802-2124. Some observed properties,
such as the low mass of the pulsar, the high mass of the WD, the moderately
long spin period, and the tight orbit, imply that this system has undergone a
peculiar formation mechanism. In this work, we attempt to simulate the detailed
evolutionary history of PSR J1802-2124. We propose that a binary system
consisting of a neutron star (NS, of mass $1.3 M_{\odot}$) and an He star (of
mass $1.0 M_{\odot}$), and with an initial orbital period of 0.5 d, may have
been the progenitor of PSR J1802-2124. Once the He star overflows its Roche
lobe, He-rich material is transferred onto the NS at a relatively high rate of
$\sim 10^{-7}-10^{-6} M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$, which is significantly higher
than the Eddington accretion rate. A large amount of the transferred material
is ejected from the vicinity of the NS by radiation pressure and results in the
birth of a mildly recycled pulsar. Our simulated results are consistent with
the observed parameters of PSR J1802-2124. Therefore, we argue that the NS + He
star evolutionary channel may be responsible for the formation of most IMBPs
with orbital periods $\la 3 \rm d$.","[{'name': 'Wen-Cong Chen'}, {'name': 'Xiang-Dong Li'}, {'name': 'Ren-Xin Xu'}]","4 pages, 3 figures, Astronomy and Astrophysics in press",http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1046v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201116532', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.1046v2']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.1051/0004-6361/201116532,"Astronomy & Astrophysics (2011) 530, A104"

Lindsay 1, NGC 339, NGC 416) and we quantify the value of delta(Y). For two
clusters (Lindsay 38, Lindsay 113) we can only determine an upper limit for
delta(Y), whilst for the two youngest clusters in our sample (Hodge 6 and NGC
1978) no conclusion about the existence of an initial He spread can be reached.
Our delta(Y) estimates are consistent with the correlation between maximum He
abundance spread and mass of the host cluster found in Galactic globular

multiple stellar populations is a standard process in massive star clusters,
not limited to a high redshift environment.","[{'name': 'W. Chantereau'}, {'name': 'M. Salaris'}, {'name': 'N. Bastian'}, {'name': 'S.

method to describe the redshift-space clustering of galaxies including the

the standard SHAM connecting the luminosity of galaxies to the maximum circular
velocity of subhalos well reproduces the luminosity dependence of
redshift-space clustering of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a wide
range of scales from 0.3 to 40 Mpc/h. The result indicates that the SHAM
approach is very promising for establishing a theoretical model of
redshift-space galaxy clustering without additional parameters. We also test
color abundance matching using two different proxies for colors: subhalo age
and local dark matter density following the method by Masaki et al. (2013b).
Observed clustering of red galaxies exhibits much stronger Fingers-of-God
effect than blue galaxies. We find that the subhalo age model describes the

dark matter density model. The result infers that the age of subhalos is a key
ingredient to determine the color of galaxies.","[{'name': 'Mikito Yamamoto'}, {'name': 'Shogo Masaki'}, {'name': 'Chiaki Hikage'}]","10 pages, 8 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03973v1,astro-ph.GA,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.CO']",,

simulation modeling of the formation of circumstellar disks from the direct
collapse of prestellar cloud cores. This has implications for many aspects of
star and planet formation, including the growth of dust and high-temperature
processing of materials. A defining result is that the early evolution of a
disk is crucially affected by the continuing mass loading from the core
envelope, and is driven into recurrent phases of gravitational instability.
Nonlinear spiral arms formed during these episodes fragment to form gaseous
clumps in the disk. These clumps generally migrate inward due to gravitational
torques arising from their interaction with a trailing spiral arm.
Occasionally, a clump can open up a gap in the disk and settle into a stable
orbit, revealing a direct pathway to the formation of companion stars, brown
dwarfs, or giant planets. At other times, when multiple clumps are present, a
low mass clump may even be ejected from the system, providing a pathway to the
formation of free-floating brown dwarfs and giant planets in addition to low
mass stars. Finally, it has been suggested that the inward migration of gaseous
clumps can provide the proper conditions for the transport of high-temperature
processed solids from the outer disk to the inner disk, and even possibly
accelerate the formation of terrestrial planets in the inner disk. All of these
features arising from clump formation and migration can be tied together
conceptually in a Migrating Embryo model for disk evolution that can complement
the well-known Core Accretion model for planet formation.","[{'name': 'Shantanu Basu'}, {'name': 'Eduard I.

is exposed to a more moderate far-ultraviolet radiation field compared with
30Dor-10, but has similar metallicity. We also combined our CO detections with
previously observed low-J CO transitions to derive the CO spectral-line energy
distribution in 30Dor-10 and N159W. The separate excitation analysis of the

K and a H2 density of about 10^4 cm^-3. We find that the molecular gas in

heating and disrupting the low--metallicity molecular gas. We use a clumpy PDR

light absorption by the disk, pulsations, LBV-type variations, and eclipses in

  339-4 across a hard-to-soft transition","We report on X-ray observations of the black-hole candidate GX 339-4 during
its 2006/2007 outburst. The hardness-intensity diagram of all RXTE/PCA data
combined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.
The evolution through the HID suggests that in the early phase of the outburst
the source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the soft
state, which is supported by our timing analysis. Broadband (4-200 keV)
spectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard
spectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft
state. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during
the brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the
softening in the hard intermediate state. In the short-lived soft intermediate
state the cutoff energy was ~ 130 keV, but was no longer detected in the soft
state. This is one of the first times that the high-energy cut-off has been
followed in such detail across several state transitions. We find that in
comparison to several other spectral parameters, the cut-off energy changes
more rapidly, just like the timing properties. The observed behaviour of the
high energy cutoff of GX 339-4 is also similar to that observed with
RXTE-INTEGRAL-Swift during the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40. These results
constitute a valuable reference to be considered when testing theoretical
models for the production of the hard component in these systems.","[{'name': 'S. Motta'}, {'name': 'T. Belloni'}, {'name': 'J. Homan'}]","16 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS Main

  40-100 Msun stars","The merger of two massive 30 Msun black holes has been detected in
gravitational waves (1,GW150914). This discovery validates recent predictions
(2-4) that massive binary black holes would constitute the first detection.
However, previous calculations have not sampled the relevant binary black hole
progenitors---massive, low-metallicity binary stars---with sufficient accuracy
and input physics to enable robust predictions to better than several orders of
magnitude (5-10). Here we report a suite of high-precision numerical
simulations of binary black hole formation via the evolution of isolated binary
stars, providing a framework to interpret GW150914 and predict the properties
of subsequent binary black hole gravitational-wave events. Our models imply
that these events form in an environment where the metallicity is less than 10
percent of solar; have initial masses of 40-100 Msun; and interact through mass
transfer and a common envelope phase. Their progenitors likely form either at 2
Gyr, or somewhat less likely, at 11 Gyr after the Big Bang. Most binary black
holes form without supernova explosions, and their spins are nearly unchanged
since birth, but do not have to be parallel. The classical field formation of
binary black holes proposed in this study, with low natal kicks and restricted
common envelope evolution, produces 40 times more binary black holes than
dynamical formation channels involving globular clusters (11) and is comparable
to the rate from homogeneous evolution channels (12-15). Our calculations
predict detections of about 1,000 black hole mergers per year with total mass
of 20-80 Msun once second generation ground-based gravitational wave
observatories reach full sensitivity.","[{'name': 'Krzysztof Belczynski', 'affiliation': 'University of Warsaw'}, {'name': 'Daniel E.

quantities such as the outflow beam power, $L_j$, the bolometric accretion disk
luminosity, $L_{bol}$, and black hole mass or Eddington luminosity, $L_{Edd}$.
When these systems produce compact radio emission and X-ray emission, they can
be placed on the fundamental plane (FP), an empirical relationship between
compact radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass. We consider a
fundamental line (FL) of black hole activity written in terms of dimensionless
intrinsic physical quantities: $\rm{log} (L_j/L_{Edd}) = A
~\rm{log}(L_{bol}/L_{Edd}) +B$ or equivalently $\rm{log} (L_j/L_{bol}) = (A-1)
~\rm{log}(L_{bol}/L_{Edd}) +B$, and show that the FP may be written in the form
of the FL. The FL has a smaller dispersion than the FP suggesting the FP
derives from the FL. Disk-dominated and jet-dominated systems have consistent
best fit FL parameters suggesting they are governed by the same physics. There
are sharp cutoffs at $L_{bol}/L_{Edd} \simeq 1$ and $L_j/L_{Edd} \simeq 0.2$,
and no indication of a strong break as $L_{bol}/L_{Edd} \rightarrow 1$.
Consistent values of $A$ are obtained for numerous samples including FRII
sources, LINERS, AGNs with compact radio emission, and Galactic black holes,
which indicate a weighted mean value of $A \simeq 0.45 \pm 0.01$. The results
suggest that a common physical mechanism related to the dimensionless
bolometric luminosity of the disk controls the jet power relative to the disk
power. The beam power $L_j$ can be obtained by combining FP best-fit parameters
and compact radio luminosity for sources that fall on the FP.","[{'name': 'Ruth. A. Daly'}, {'name': 'Douglas A. Stout'}, {'name': 'Jeremy N. Mysliwiec'}]","Published in the Astrophysical Journal, 863, 117-122; 6 pages; 2

hypothetical systems with high mutual inclination. We show that large
amplitude, high frequency obliquity oscillations on Earth-like exoplanets can
suppress the ice-albedo feedback, increasing the outer edge of the habitable
zone. We restrict our exploration to hypothetical systems consisting of a
solar-mass star, an Earth-mass planet at 1 AU, and 1 or 2 larger planets. We
verify that these systems are stable for $10^8$ years with N-body simulations,
and calculate the obliquity variations induced by the orbital evolution of the
Earth-mass planet and a torque from the host star. We run a simplified energy
balance model on the terrestrial planet to assess surface temperature and ice
coverage on the planet's surface, and we calculate differences in the outer
edge of the habitable zone for planets with rapid obliquity variations. For
each hypothetical system, we calculate the outer edge of habitability for two
conditions: 1) the full evolution of the planetary spin and orbit, and 2) the
eccentricity and obliquity fixed at their average values. We recover previous
results that higher values of fixed obliquity and eccentricity expand the
habitable zone, but also find that obliquity oscillations further expand
habitable orbits in all cases. Terrestrial planets near the outer edge of the
habitable zone may be more likely to support life in systems that induce rapid
obliquity oscillations as opposed to fixed-spin planets. Such planets may be
the easiest to directly characterize with space-borne telescopes.","[{'name': 'J. C. Armstrong'}, {'name': 'R. Barnes'}, {'name': 'S. Domagal-Goldman'}, {'name': 'J. Breiner'}, {'name': 'T. R.

  wind","Young stars are associated with prominent outflows of molecular gas. The
ejection of gas via these outflows is believed to remove angular momentum from
the protostellar system, thus permitting young stars to grow by accretion of
material from the protostellar disk. The underlying mechanism for outflow
ejection is not yet understood, but is believed to be closely linked to the
protostellar disk. Assorted scenarios have been proposed to explain
protostellar outflows; the main difference between these models is the region
where acceleration of material takes place: close to the protostar itself
('X-wind', or stellar wind), in a larger region throughout the protostellar
disk (disk wind), or at the interface between. Because of the limits of
observational studies, outflow launching regions have so far only been probed
by indirect extrapolation. Here we report observations of carbon monoxide
toward the outflow associated with the TMC1A protostellar system. These data
show that gas is ejected from a region extending up to a radial distance of 25
astronomical units from the central protostar, and that angular momentum is
removed from an extended region of the disk. This demonstrates that the
outflowing gas is launched by an extended disk wind from a Keplerian disk.
Hence, we rule out X-wind and stellar wind launching scenarios as the source of
the emission on the scales we observe.","[{'name': 'Per Bjerkeli'}, {'name': 'Matthijs H. D. van der Wiel'}, {'name': 'Daniel Harsono'}, {'name': 'Jon P. Ramsey'}, {'name': 'Jes K.

Covering two adjacent seasons in 2007 and 2008, new photometric data are
gathered for 3048 objects in the field of M53. By using the OIS method and
subsequently TFA, we search for variables in the full sample by using DFT and
BLS methods. We select variables based on the statistics related to these
methods combined with visual inspections. We identified 12 new variables (2 RR
Lyrae stars, 7 short periodic stars - 3 of them are SX Phe stars - and 3
long-period variables). No eclipsing binaries were found in the present sample.
Except for the 3 (hitherto unknown) Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, no multiperiodic
variables were found. We showed that after proper period shift, the PLC
relation for the first overtone RR Lyrae sample tightly follows the one spanned
by the fundamental stars. Furthermore, the slope is in agreement with the one
derived from other clusters. Based on the earlier Baade-Wesselink calibration
of the PLC relations, the derived reddening-free distance modulus of M53 is
16.31 +/- 0.04 mag, corresponding to a distance modulus of 18.5 mag for the
Large Magellanic Cloud. From the Fourier parameters of the RRab stars we
obtained an average iron abundance of -1.58 +/- 0.03. This is ~0.5 dex higher
than the overall abundance of the giants as given in the literature and derived
in this paper from the three-color photometry of giants. We suspect that the

behaviour in their light curves. We focus primarily on hot stars, where both

  We analyse the feasibility of classical methods for period searches in a
nonlinear chaotic system, such as the R\""ossler system, where a period does not
exist at all. As an astrophysical application of the chaotic system, we utilize
a simple model of stellar pulsation with two different sets of parameters
corresponding to periodic and chaotic behaviour. For both models we create a
synthetic signal, and then apply widely used methods for period finding, such
as the phase dispersion method and periodograms. For comparison, a
quasi-periodic signal is employed as well.
  The period analysis indicates periods even for the chaotic signal. Such
periods are apparently spurious. This implies that it is very problematic to
distinguish chaotic and quasiperiodic process by such an analysis only.","[{'name': 'V. Votruba'}, {'name': 'P. Koubský'}, {'name': 'D. Korčáková'}, {'name': 'F.

quite suitable for handling data on cosmic ray nuclei energy spectra and
composition at E ? 1 GeV [1,2]. In the leakybox model a full information about
cosmic ray propagation in Galaxy is compressed to the single parameter - escape
length, Xe, characterizing mean grams of a matter passed by cosmic rays from
sources to the Earth. In this paper we analyze the world data on proton and
iron cosmic ray spectra collected in the past (HEAO, CRN et al.) and in series
of recent electronic experiments (ATIC, CREAM, MS, BESS, Tracer et al.) and
obtain the rigidity dependence of escape length, Xe(R) = R^(-0.47\pm-0.03),
from the measured rigidity dependence of the protons/iron ratio. It quite
agrees with the one stimated in standard manner from the secondary/primary
nuclei ratio. But at R > 300 GV the behavior of Xe(R)distinctly changes, that

suppression, which reduces the dynamic range of the Fast Fourier Transform
spectrometers (FFTS), and implement this procedure in the Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) of the FFTS. This is achieved by applying a calibration on
the complex amplitude spectrum. Modern multi-beam heterodyne receivers are
equipped with a large number of independent signal chains, which leads to a
complex system that consumes space as well as power and is expensive. To reduce
the complexity of the receiver array the intermediate frequency (IF) band is
4-8 GHz, which requires the FFTS to sample this band directly.
  The input bandwidth of 4 GHz of the current generation of FFTS cannot be
sampled with a single analog-digital converter (ADC). To reach that bandwidth,
multiple ADCs sample the same signal at different points in time. The method is
called \""time interleaved sampling\"". The characteristics of the ADCs differ
from each other, which leads to mirror signals in the spectrum. These mirror
signals can reduce the dynamic range of the spectrometers. Therefore the
mismatches must be actively corrected. The current generation of FFTS use a
frequency independent calibration, which optimizes the mirror suppression at
one fixed frequency. This it is not optimal as some of the mismatches are
frequency dependent and their impact increases with frequency.
  The procedure developed during this thesis work involves three steps. First
the mismatches are measured over the frequency band. Then filter coefficients
are calculated from these mismatches using a model of a time interleaved ADC.
These filter coefficients are then applied to the complex amplitude spectra of
the ADCs. The newly implemented calibration improves the mirror suppression up
to 20 dB compared to the frequency independent calibration.",{'name': 'Gerrit Grutzeck'},,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10332v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10332v1,astro-ph.IM,['astro-ph.IM'],,

fluids in average and their intrinsic isotropy have made these models very
fruitful in cosmology. In this work we will analyse the perturbations dynamics
in these theories assuming general power law potentials $V(\phi)=\lambda
\vert\phi\vert^{n}/n$. At leading order in the wavenumber expansion, a simple
expression for the effective sound speed of perturbations is obtained
$c_{\text{eff}}^2 = \omega=(n-2)/(n+2)$ with $\omega$ the effective equation of
state. We also obtain the first order correction in
$k^2/\omega_{\text{eff}}^2$, when the wavenumber $k$ of the perturbations is
much smaller than the background oscillation frequency, $\omega_{\text{eff}}$.
For the standard massive case we have also analysed general anharmonic
contributions to the effective sound speed. These results are reached through a
perturbed version of the generalized virial theorem and also studying the exact

$\delta\phi$; and for sub-Hubble modes, exploiting Floquet's theorem.","[{'name': 'J. A. R. Cembranos'}, {'name': 'A. L. Maroto'}, {'name': 'S. J. Núñez Jareño'}]","13 pages, 6 figures.

and other volatiles to terrestrial planets as most of them contain significant
amounts of hydrous mineral phases. As such, carbonaceous chondrites are
candidate building blocks for Earth, and elucidating their thermal histories is
of direct important for understanding the volatile element history of Earth and
the terrestrial planets. A significant fraction of CM type carbonaceous
chondrites are thermally metamorphosed or heated and have lost part of their
water content. The origin and the timing of such heating events are still
debated, as they could have occurred either in the first Myrs of the Solar
System via short-lived radioactive heating, or later by impact induced heating
and or solar radiation. Since Rb is more volatile than Sr, and some heated CM
chondrites are highly depleted in Rb, a dating system based on the radioactive
decay of 87Rb to 87Sr could be used to date the heating event relating to the
fractionation of Rb and Sr. Here, we have leveraged the 87Rb 87Sr system to
date the heating of five CM chondrites (PCA 02012, PCA 02010, PCA 91008, QUE
93005 and MIL 07675). We find that the heating events of all five meteorites
occurred at least 3 Ga after the formation of the Solar System. Such timing
excludes short-lived radioactive heating as the origin of thermal metamorphism

their lower albedos, lower optical depths, and smaller self-shadowing effect.
We also find that the C ring and the Cassini Division were considerably
brighter than the B and A rings in the MIR in 2008 and the radial contrast of
the ring brightness is the inverse of that in 2005, which is interpreted as a

  SN 2014J in M82","The very nearby Type Ia supernova 2014J in M82 offers a rare opportunity to
study the physics of thermonuclear supernovae at extremely late phases
($\gtrsim$800 days). Using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we obtained six
epochs of high precision photometry for SN 2014J from 277 days to 1181 days
past the $B-$band maximum light. The reprocessing of electrons and X-rays
emitted by the radioactive decay chain $^{57}$Co$\rightarrow ^{57}$Fe are
needed to explain the significant flattening of both the $F606W$-band and the
pseudo-bolometric light curves. The flattening confirms previous predictions
that the late-time evolution of type Ia supernova luminosities requires
additional energy input from the decay of $^{57}$Co (Seitenzahl et al. 2009).
By assuming the $F606W$-band luminosity scales with the bolometric luminosity
at $\sim$500 days after the $B-$band maximum light, a mass ratio
$^{57}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni$\sim$0.065$_{-0.004}^{+0.005}$ is required. This mass ratio
is roughly $\sim$3 times the solar ratio and favors a progenitor white dwarf
with a mass near the Chandrasekhar limit. A similar fit using the constructed
pseudo-bolometric luminosity gives a mass ratio
$^{57}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni$\sim$0.066$_{-0.008}^{+0.009}$. Astrometric tests based on

""ground state alignment"" as a new way to determine the magnetic field direction
in diffuse medium. The alignment is due to anisotropic radiation impinging on
the atom/ion. The consequence of the process is the polarization of spectral
lines resulting from scattering and absorption from aligned atomic/ionic
species with fine or hyperfine structure. The magnetic field induces precession
and realign the atom/ion and therefore the polarization of the emitted or
absorbed radiation reflects the direction of the magnetic field. The atoms get
aligned at their low levels and, as the life-time of the atoms/ions we deal
with is long, the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation is susceptible to
extremely weak magnetic fields ($1{\rm G}\gtrsim B\gtrsim 10^{-15}$G). In fact,
the effects of atomic/ionic alignment were studied in the laboratory decades
ago, mostly in relation to the maser research. Recently, the atomic effect has
been already detected in observations from circumstellar medium and this is a
harbinger of future extensive magnetic field studies. A unique feature of the
atomic realignment is that they can reveal the 3D orientation of magnetic
field. In this article, we shall review the basic physical processes involved
in atomic realignment. We shall also discuss its applications to
interplanetary, circumstellar and interstellar magnetic fields. In addition,
our research reveals that the polarization of the radiation arising from the
transitions between fine and hyperfine states of the ground level can provide a
unique diagnostics of magnetic fields in the Epoch of Reionization.","[{'name': 'Huirong Yan'}, {'name': 'A. Lazarian'}]","30 pages, 12 figures, chapter in Lecture Notes in Physics ""Magnetic

Galaxy and report the presence of dark features that coincide with dense
molecular clouds. Unlike infrared dark clouds, these features which we call
""radio dark clouds"" are produced by a deficiency in radio continuum emission
from molecular clouds that are embedded in a bath of UV radiation field or
synchrotron emitting cosmic ray particles. The contribution of the continuum
emission along different pathlengths results in dark features that trace
embedded molecular clouds. The new technique of identifying cold clouds can
place constraints on the depth and the magnetic field of molecular clouds when
compared to those of the surrounding hot plasma radiating at radio wavelengths.
The study of five molecular complexes in the inner Galaxy, Sgr A, Sgr B2, radio
Arc, the snake filament and G359.75-0.13 demonstrate an anti--correlation
between the distributions of radio continuum and molecular line and dust
emission. Radio dark clouds are identified in GBT maps and VLA images taken
with uniform sampling of {\it uv} coverage. The level at which the continuum
flux is suppressed in these sources suggests that the depth of the molecular
cloud is similar to the size of the continuum emission within a factor of two.
These examples suggest that high resolution, high dynamic range continuum
images can be powerful probes of interacting molecular clouds with massive
stars and supernova remnants in regions where the kinematic distance estimates
are ambiguous as well as in the nuclei of active galaxies.","{'name': 'F.

oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) variables and 2) to increase the
number of such stars for which the Li abundance has been measured to provide
constraints on theoretical models of extra-mixing processes. To this end, we
analysed high-resolution spectra of 18 sample stars for the presence of
absorption lines of Tc and Li. The abundance of the latter was determined by
comparing the observed spectra to hydrostatic MARCS model spectra. Bolometric
magnitudes were established from near-IR photometry and pulsation periods. We
reclassify the star V441 Cyg as Tc-rich, and the unusual Mira star R Hya, as
well as W Eri, as Tc-poor. The abundance of Li, or an upper limit to it, was
determined for all of the sample stars. In all stars with Tc we also detected
Li. Most of them have a Li content slightly below the solar photospheric value,
except for V441 Cyg, which has ~1000 times the solar abundance. We also found
that, similar to Tc, a lower luminosity limit seems to exist for the presence
of Li. We conclude that the higher Li abundance found in the cooler and higher
luminosity objects could stem from a Li production mechanism operating on the
AGB. The stellar mass might have a crucial influence on this (extra-mixing)
production mechanism. It was speculated that the declining pulsation period of
R Hya is caused by a recent thermal pulse (TP). While not detecting Tc does not
rule out a TP, it indicates that the TPs are not strong enough to drive
dredge-up in R Hya. V441 Cyg, on the other hand, could either be a low-mass,
intrinsic S-star that produced its large amount of Li by extra-mixing
processes, or an intermediate-mass star (M>=M_sun) undergoing Li production due
to hot bottom burning.","[{'name': 'Stefan Uttenthaler', 'affiliation': 'Instituut voor Sterrenkunde, K. U.

SFR/M* > -8.7, we expect that the observed properties of these LBGs are

individually detected X-ray sources (potential AGN), is expected to be powered
by X-ray binaries and hot gas. We find, for the first time, evidence of
evolution in the X-ray/SFR relation. Based on X-ray stacking analyses for z<4

luminosity evolves weakly with redshift (z) and SFR as log LX = 0.93 log (1+z)
+ 0.65 log SFR + 39.80. By comparing our observations with sophisticated X-ray
binary population synthesis models, we interpret that the redshift evolution of
LX/SFR is driven by metallicity evolution in HMXBs, likely the dominant
population in these high sSFR galaxies. We also compare these models with our
observations of X-ray luminosity density (total 2-10 keV luminosity per Mpc^3)

the Doppler shift directly from a heterodyne measurement of the returned
optical signal. The second aims to improve the precision of the first by
suppressing atmospheric phase noise imprinted on the transmitted optical
signal. We demonstrate the performance of each technique over a 2.2 km
horizontal link with a simulated in-line velocity Doppler shift at the far end.
A horizontal link of this length has been estimated to exhibit nearly half the
total integrated atmospheric turbulence of a vertical link to space. Without
stabilisation of the atmospheric effects, we obtained an estimated range rate
precision of 17 um/s at 1 s of integration. With active suppression of
atmospheric phase noise, this improved by three orders-of-magnitude to an
estimated range rate precision of 9.0 nm/s at 1 second of integration, and 1.1
nm/s when integrated over a 60 s. This represents four orders-of-magnitude
improvement over the typical performance of operational ground to space X-Band
systems in terms of range-rate precision at the same integration time.
  The performance of this system is a promising proof of concept for coherent
optical Doppler orbitography. There are many additional challenges associated
with performing these techniques from ground to space, that were not captured
within the preliminary experiments presented here. In the future, we aim to
progress towards a 10 km horizontal link to replicate the expected atmospheric
turbulence for a ground to space link.","[{'name': 'Benjamin P. Dix-Matthews'}, {'name': 'Sascha W. Schediwy'}, {'name': 'David R.

and can resolve previously undetected extended and diffuse emissions, which
brings great challenges for the detection and morphological classification of
extended sources. We present HeTu-v2, a deep learning-based source detector
that uses the combined networks of Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural
Networks (Mask R-CNN) and a Transformer block to achieve high-quality radio
sources segmentation and classification. The sources are classified into 5
categories: Compact or point-like sources (CS), Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FRI),
Fanaroff-Riley Type II (FRII), Head-Tail (HT), and Core-Jet (CJ) sources.
HeTu-v2 has been trained and validated with the data from the Faint Images of
the Radio Sky at Twenty-one centimeters (FIRST). We found that HeTu-v2 has a
high accuracy with a mean average precision ($AP_{\rm @50:5:95}$) of 77.8%,
which is 15.6 points and 11.3 points higher than that of HeTu-v1 and the
original Mask R-CNN respectively. We produced a FIRST morphological catalog
(FIRST-HeTu) using HeTu-v2, which contains 835,435 sources and achieves 98.6%
of completeness and up to 98.5% of accuracy compared to the latest 2014 data
release of the FIRST survey. HeTu-v2 could also be employed for other
astronomical tasks like building sky models, associating radio components, and
classifying radio galaxies.","[{'name': 'Baoqiang Lao'}, {'name': 'Sumit Jaiswal'}, {'name': 'Zhen Zhao'}, {'name': 'Leping Lin'}, {'name': 'Junyi Wang'}, {'name': 'Xiaohui Sun'}, {'name': 'Shengli Qin'}]","20 pages, 15 figures, Accepted by Astronomy and Computing",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01426v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2023.100728', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01426v2']",astro-ph.IM,['astro-ph.IM'],10.1016/j.ascom.2023.100728,"2023, Astronomy and Computing Volume 44, Pages 100728"

  Epoch Observations of NGC 300 with Chandra","We have obtained three epochs of Chandra ACIS-I observations (totaling
$\sim$184 ks) of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC~300 to study the logN-logS
distributions of its X-ray point source population down to
$\sim$2$\times$10$^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 0.35-8 keV band
(equivalent to $\sim$10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The individual epoch logN-logS
distributions are best described as the sum of a background AGN component, a
simple power law, and a broken power law, with the shape of the logN-logS
distributions sometimes varying between observations. The simple power law and
AGN components produce a good fit for ""persistent"" sources (i.e., with fluxes
that remain constant within a factor of $\sim$2). The differential power law
index of $\sim$1.2 and high fluxes suggest that the persistent sources
intrinsic to NGC~300 are dominated by Roche lobe overflowing low mass X-ray
binaries. The variable X-ray sources are described by a broken power law, with
a faint-end power law index of $\sim$1.7, a bright-end index of $\sim$2.8-4.9,
and a break flux of $\sim$8$\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$
($\sim$4$\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting they are mostly outbursting,
wind-fed high mass X-ray binaries, although the logN-logS distribution of
variable sources likely also contains low-mass X-ray binaries. We generate
model logN-logS distributions for synthetic X-ray binaries and constrain the
distribution of maximum X-ray fluxes attained during outburst. Our observations
suggest that the majority of outbursting X-ray binaries occur at sub-Eddington
luminosities, where mass transfer likely occurs through direct wind accretion
at $\sim$1-3% of the Eddington rate.","[{'name': 'Breanna Binder'}, {'name': 'Jacob Gross'}, {'name': 'Benjamin F. Williams'}, {'name': 'Michael Eracleous'}, {'name': 'Terrance J.

  Worlds","The recent advancements in exoplanet observations enable the potential
detection of exo-Venuses, rocky planets with carbon-rich atmospheres. How
extended these atmospheres can be, given high carbon abundances, has not been
studied. To answer this, we present a model for a theoretical class of
exoplanets - puffy Venuses - characterized by thick, carbon-dominated
atmospheres in equilibrium with global magma oceans. Our model accounts for
carbon and hydrogen partition between the atmosphere and the magma ocean, as
well as the C-H-O equilibrium chemistry throughout a semi-grey,
radiative-convective atmosphere. We find that radius inflation by puffy Venus
atmospheres is significant on small and irradiated planets: carbon content of
1200 ppm (or that of ordinary chondrites) can generate an atmosphere of ~0.16 -
0.3 $R_{\oplus}$ for an Earth-mass planet with equilibrium temperatures of 1500
to 2000 K. We identify TOI-561 b as an especially promising puffy Venus
candidate, whose under-density could be attributed to a thick C-rich
atmosphere. We also advocate for a puffy Venus interpretation of 55 Cancri e,
where recent JWST observation indicates the presence of a CO/CO2 atmosphere.
Puffy Venuses may thus constitute a testable alternative interpretation for the

spectroscopically observed 64 candidate LAEs in the ECDFS, confirming 46
objects as z~4.5 LAEs. We did not detect significant flux from neither C_iv

Population III star formation rate (SFR) to be <0.3% of the total SFR, and
<1.25% of the observed SFR (both at the 2-$\sigma$ level). Only one LAE was
detected in both the X-ray and radio, while the other objects remained
undetected, even when stacked. The Lya LF in our two deepest narrowband filters
in the ECDFS differ at >2$\sigma$ significance, and the product $L^*\Phi^*$
differs by a factor of >3. Similar LF differences have been used to infer
evolution in the neutral gas fraction in the intergalactic medium at z>6, yet
here the difference is likely due to cosmic variance, given that the two
samples are from adjoining line-of-sight volumes. Combining our new sample of
LAEs with those from previous LALA narrowband surveys at z = 4.5, we obtain one
of the best measured Lya LFs to date of L* = 42.83 $\pm$ 0.06 and $\Phi^*$ =

the evolution of the Lya luminosity density at 0 < z < 7. We find tentative
evidence for evolution in the product $L^* \Phi^*$, which approximately tracks
the cosmic SFR density, but since field-to-field and survey-to-survey

dramatically increase the emitted luminosity by converting kinetic energy to

$\sim 10^{51}$ erg, attainable by thermalising most of the kinetic energy of a

similar spectra and even larger energies, but are difficult to distinguish from
accretion onto the supermassive black hole. Here we present a new event,
SN2016aps, offset from the centre of a low-mass galaxy, that radiated $\gtrsim
5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, necessitating a hyper-energetic supernova explosion. We
find a total (SN ejecta $+$ CSM) mass likely exceeding 50-100 M$_\odot$, with

supernovae (PISNe) or pulsational PISNe -- theoretically-predicted

  Entrainment and Core Impact","We present ALMA Cycle 1 observations of the HH46/47 molecular outflow using
combined 12m array and ACA observations. The improved angular resolution and
sensitivity of our multi-line maps reveal structures that help us study the
entrainment process in much more detail and allow us to obtain more precise
estimates of outflow properties than previous observations. We use 13CO(1-0)
and C18O(1-0) emission to correct for the 12CO(1-0) optical depth to accurately
estimate the outflow mass, momentum and kinetic energy. This correction
increases the estimates of the mass, momentum and kinetic energy by factors of
about 9, 5 and 2, respectively, with respect to estimates assuming optically
thin emission. The new 13CO and C18O data also allow us to trace denser and
slower outflow material than that traced by the 12CO maps, and they reveal an
outflow cavity wall at very low velocities (as low as 0.2km/s with respect to
the cores central velocity). Adding with the slower material traced only by
13CO and C18O, there is another factor of 3 increase in the mass estimate and
50% increase in the momentum estimate. The estimated outflow properties
indicate that the outflow is capable of dispersing the parent core within the
typical lifetime of the embedded phase of a low-mass protostar, and that it is
responsible for a core-to-star efficiency of 1/4 to 1/3. We find that the
outflow cavity wall is composed of multiple shells associated with a series of
jet bow-shock events. Within about 3000AU of the protostar the 13CO and C18O
emission trace a circumstellar envelope with both rotation and infall motions,
which we compare with a simple analytic model. The CS(2-1) emission reveals
tentative evidence of a slowly-moving rotating outflow, which we suggest is
entrained not only poloidally but also toroidally by a disk wind that is
launched from relatively large radii from the source.","[{'name': 'Yichen Zhang'}, {'name': 'Hector G. Arce'}, {'name': 'Diego Mardones'}, {'name': 'Sylvie Cabrit'}, {'name': 'Michael M.

catalog by modelling the aliasing phenomenon that distorts the true
distribution of periods. We have represented the problem by a 2-level

band, is usually performed through an initial Fourier analysis to find
""candidate"" frequencies and then refined through the folding of the time series
using trial frequencies close to the candidate. In order to establish the
significance of the pulsed profiles found at these trial frequencies, pulsed
profiles are evaluated with a chi-squared test, to establish how much they
depart from a null hypothesis where the signal is consistent with a flat
distribution of noisy measurements. In high-energy astronomy, the chi-squared
statistic has widely been replaced by the $Z^2_n$ statistic and the H-test as
they are more sensitive to extra information such as the harmonic content of
the pulsed profile. The $Z^2_n$ statistic and H-test were originally developed
for the use with ""event data"", composed of arrival times of single photons,
leaving it unclear how these methods could be used in radio astronomy. In this
paper, we present a version of the $Z^2_n$ statistic and H-test for pulse
profiles with Gaussian uncertainties, appropriate for radio or even optical
pulse profiles. We show how these statistical indicators provide better
sensitivity to low-significance pulsar candidates with respect to the usual
chi-squared method, and a straightforward way to discriminate between pulse
profile shapes. Moreover, they provide an additional tool for Radio Frequency

that the apparent luminosity of accreting neutron stars (NSs) can exceed the
Eddington luminosity by a factor of hundreds. The relation between the actual
and apparent luminosity is a key ingredient in theoretical models of ULXs but
it is still under debate. A typical feature of the discovered pulsating ULXs is
a large pulsed fraction (PF). Using Monte Carlo simulations, we consider a
simple geometry of accretion flow and test the possibility of simultaneous
presence of a large luminosity amplification due the geometrical beaming and a
high PF. We argue that these factors largely exclude each other and only a
negligible fraction of strongly beamed ULX pulsars can show PF above 10 per
cent. Discrepancy between this conclusion and current observations indicate
that pulsating ULXs are not strongly beamed and their apparent luminosity is
close to the actual one.","[{'name': 'Alexander A. Mushtukov'}, {'name': 'Simon Portegies Zwart'}, {'name': 'Sergey S. Tsygankov'}, {'name': 'Dmitrij I.

  Gramma-ray Bursts and Their Connection with Short Gamma-ray Bursts","Short and long Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in subclasses with specific
energy release, spectra, duration, etc, and have binary progenitors. We review
here the binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) subclass whose progenitor is a
CO$_\textrm{core}$-neutron star (NS). The supernova (SN) explosion of the
CO$_\textrm{core}$ produces at its center a new NS ($\nu$NS) and triggers a
hypercritical accretion onto the NS. The NS can become a more massive NS or
collapse into a black hole (BH). We summarize this topic from the first
analytic estimates in 2012 to the most recent three-dimensional (3D)
smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations in 2018. Long GRBs
are richer and more complex than previously thought. The SN and the accretion
explain X-ray precursors. The NS accretion, its collapse and the BH formation
produce asymmetries in the SN ejecta, implying a 3D GRB analysis. The newborn
BH surrounded by the ejecta and the magnetic field inherited from the NS, are
the \emph{inner engine} from which the electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) plasma and
the high-energy emission initiate. The $e^+e^-$ impact on the ejecta converts
the SN into a hypernova (HN). The plasma dynamics in the ejecta explains the
ultrarelativistic prompt emission in the MeV domain and the mildly-relativistic
flares of the early afterglow in the X-ray domain. The feedback of the $\nu$NS
emission on the HN explains the X-ray late afterglow and its power-law regime.
All the above is in contrast with GRB models attempting to explain all the GRB
phases with the kinetic energy of anultrarelativistic jet, as traditionally
proposed in the ""collapsar-fireball"" model. In addition, BdHNe in their
different flavors lead to $\nu$NS-NS or $\nu$NS-BH binaries. These binaries
merge by gravitational wave emission producing short GRBs, establishing a
connection between long and short GRBs and their occurrence rates.","[{'name': 'J. A. Rueda'}, {'name': 'R. Ruffini'}, {'name': 'Y. Wang'}]","Invited Review Published by Universe as part of the Special Issue

structure, we compare far infrared dust emission, CO emission, and dynamics in
the star-forming complex N83 in the Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud. Dust
emission (measured by Spitzer as part of the S3MC and SAGE-SMC surveys) probes
the total gas column independent of molecular line emission and traces
shielding from photodissociating radiation. We calibrate a method to estimate
the dust column using only the high-resolution Spitzer data and verify that
dust traces the ISM in the HI-dominated region around N83. This allows us to
resolve the relative structures of H2, dust, and CO within a giant molecular
cloud complex, one of the first times such a measurement has been made in a
low-metallicity galaxy. Our results support the hypothesis that CO is
photodissociated while H2 self-shields in the outer parts of low-metallicity
GMCs, so that dust/self shielding is the primary factor determining the
distribution of CO emission. Four pieces of evidence support this view. First,
the CO-to-H2 conversion factor averaged over the whole cloud is very high 4-11
\times 10^21 cm^-2/(K km/s), or 20-55 times the Galactic value. Second, the
CO-to-H2 conversion factor varies across the complex, with its lowest (most
nearly Galactic) values near the CO peaks. Third, bright CO emission is largely
confined to regions of relatively high line-of-sight extinction, A_V >~ 2 mag,
in agreement with PDR models and Galactic observations. Fourth, a simple model
in which CO emerges from a smaller sphere nested inside a larger cloud can
roughly relate the H2 masses measured from CO kinematics and dust.","[{'name': 'A. K. Leroy'}, {'name': 'A. Bolatto'}, {'name': 'C. Bot'}, {'name': 'C. W. Engelbracht'}, {'name': 'K.

find that the expected numbers of the Population III pair-instability supernova
detections increase about a factor of 2 if the near-infrared transient surveys
are performed towards clusters of galaxies. Other supernovae such as Population
II pair-instability supernovae would also be detected in the same survey. This

pre-requisite for interpretation of observations of molecules whose energy
levels are populated under non local thermodynamical equilibrium conditions. In
the current study, we present collisional rate coefficients for the NH$_2$D /

scaled according to a few CC reference points. These reference points are
subsequently used to estimate the accuracy of the rate coefficients for higher
levels, which is mainly limited by the use of the CS formalism. Considering the
current potential energy surface, the rate coefficients are thus expected to be
accurate to within 5\% for the levels below $J_\tau = 4_2$, while we estimate

nova-like outbursts are generated by the accretion of a high mass loss rate red

the small footprint of these surveys. We introduce a systematic Halpha emission
line object survey for new symbiotic stars covering 35 deg^2 towards the

symbiotic stars, more than a dozen probable symbiotic stars, and several other

the lightcurves do exhibit semi-regular and Mira pulsations, orbital variations

elements, thereby enriching their surrounding pristine gas. Previous detections
of metals in intergalactic gas clouds, however, find a heavy element enrichment
larger than $1/1000$ times that of the solar environment, higher than expected
for PopIII remnants. In this letter we report the discovery of a Lyman limit
system (LLS) at $z=3.53$ with the lowest metallicity seen in gas with
discernable metals, $10^{-3.41\pm0.26}$ times the solar value, at a level
expected for PopIII remnants. We make the first relative abundance measurement
in such low metallicity gas: the carbon-to-silicon ratio is $10^{-0.26\pm0.17}$
times the solar value. This is consistent with models of gas enrichment by a
PopIII star formation event early in the Universe, but also consistent with
later, Population II enrichment. The metals in all three components comprising
the LLS, which has a velocity width of 400 km s$^{-1}$, are offset in velocity
by $\sim+6$ km s$^{-1}$ from the bulk of the hydrogen, suggesting the LLS was
enriched by a single event. Relative abundance measurements in this

  K2-18b, Part I: the Effects of Atmospheric Dynamics","The low equilibrium temperatures of temperate sub-Neptunes lead to extremely
long chemical timescales in their upper atmospheres, causing the abundances of
chemical species to be strongly shaped by atmospheric transport. Here, we used
a three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model involving a passive tracer
to investigate the atmospheric circulation and 3D transport of temperate
gas-rich sub-Neptunes, using K2-18b as an example. We model K2-18b as a
synchronous or asynchronous rotator, exploring spin-orbit resonances (SOR) of
2:1, 6:1, and 10:1. We find that the strong absorption of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$
induces a detached convective zone between 1 and 5 bar, resulting in strong
vertical mixing at these levels. The upper atmosphere is dominated by eastward
winds (an equatorial superrotating jet present in all simulations), leading to
warmer evening terminators and approximately 20% higher passive tracer mass
mixing ratios compared to the morning terminators. Rotation rates have minimal
impact on the strength of global mean vertical mixing, but significantly
influence the latitudinal distribution of passive tracers. For synchronous, 2:1
SOR, and 6:1 SOR simulations, passive tracers are more abundant in the
upwelling branches at latitudes within 60$^\circ$, while for the 10:1 SOR
simulation, strong transient eddies at high latitudes (>70$^\circ$) between 0.1
to 1 bar can transport passive tracers upward from the deep atmosphere, making
them more abundant there, despite their alignment with the downwelling branch
of the large-scale circulation. This study focuses on the atmospheric dynamics
and its influence on passive tracer transport, while a follow-up paper will
incorporate active chemical species.","[{'name': 'Jiachen Liu'}, {'name': 'Duncan Christie'}, {'name': 'Jun Yang'}]","19 pages, 17 figures, accepted to MNRAS",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23891v3,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staf1078', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23891v3']",astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],10.1093/mnras/staf1078,

  during the Cosmological First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition","We present a theory of the generation of magnetic seed fields in bubble
collisions during a first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) possible
for some choices of parameters in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model.
The theory extends earlier work and is formulated to assess the importance of
surface dynamics in such collisions. We are led to linearized equations of
motion with O(3) symmetry appropriate for examining collisions in which the
Higgs field is relatively unperturbed from its mean value in the collision
volume. Coherent evolution of the charged $W$ fields within the bubbles is the
main source of the electromagnetic current for generating the seed fields, with
fermions also contributing through the conductivity terms. We present numerical
simulations within this formulation to quantify the role of the surface of the
colliding bubbles, particularly the thickness of the surface, and to show how
conclusions drawn from earlier work are modified. The main sensitivity arises
such that the steeper the bubble surface the more enhanced the seed fields
become. Consequently, the magnetic seed fields may be several times larger and
smoother over the collision volume than found in earlier studies. Our work thus
provides additional support to the supposition that magnetic fields produced
during the EWPT in the early universe seed the galactic and extra-galactic
magnetic fields observed today.","[{'name': 'Trevor Stevens'}, {'name': 'Mikkel B. Johnson'}]","24 pages, 19 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3694v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.3694v1,astro-ph.CO,['astro-ph.CO'],,

  found","The colour evolution of reddened Type Ia supernovae can place strong
constraints on the location of dust and help address the question of whether
the observed extinction stems from the interstellar medium or from
circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor. Here we analyse BV
photometry of 48 reddened Type Ia supernovae from the literature and estimate
the dust location from their $B-V$ colour evolution. We find a time-variable
colour excess $E(B-V)$ for 15 supernovae in our sample and constrain dust to
distances between 0.013 and 45 pc ($4\times10^{16}-10^{20}$ cm). For the
remaining supernovae, we obtain a constant $E(B-V)$ evolution and place lower
limits on the dust distance from the explosion. In all the 48 supernovae, the
inferred dust location is compatible with an interstellar origin for the
extinction. This is corroborated by the observation that supernovae with
relatively nearby dust ($\lesssim$ 1 pc) are located close to the center of
their host galaxy, in high-density dusty regions where interactions between the
supernova radiation and interstellar clouds close by are likely to occur. For
supernovae showing time-variable $E(B-V)$, we identify a potential preference
for low $R_\mathrm{V}$ values, unusually strong sodium absorption and
blue-shifted and time-variable absorption features. Within the interstellar
framework, this brings evidence to a proposed scenario where cloud-cloud
collisions induced by the supernova radiation pressure can shift the grain size
distribution to smaller values and enhance the abundance of sodium in the
gaseous phase.","[{'name': 'M. Bulla'}, {'name': 'A. Goobar'}, {'name': 'S.

indirect searches. There have been recent reassessments of the expected DM
gamma-ray signals in case of long-range interactions, commonly known as
Sommerfeld enhancement. Since details of the underlying DM phase-space
distribution function become critical, there are potentially large
uncertainties in the final result. We provide here a first attempt towards a
comprehensive investigation of these systematics, addressing the impact on the
expected DM flux from Milky Way dwarfs via Bayesian inference on the available
stellar kinematic datasets. After reconsidering the study case of ergodic
systems, we investigate for the first time scenarios where DM particle orbits
may have a radial or tangential bias. We consider both cuspy and cored
parametric DM density profiles, together with the case of a non-parametric halo
modelling directly connected to line-of-sight observable quantities. The main
findings of our work highlight the relevance of the assumed phase-space
distribution: Referring to a generalized J-factor, namely the line-of-sight
convolution of the spatial part in case of velocity-dependent annihilation
rate, an enhancement (suppression) with respect to the limit of isotropic
phase-space distributions is obtained for the case of tangentially (radially)
biased DM particle orbits. We provide new estimates for J-factors for the eight
brightest Milky Way dwarfs also in the limit of velocity-independent DM
annihilation, in good agreement with previous results in literature, and derive
data-driven lower-bounds based on the non-parametric modelling of the halo
density. The outcome of our broad study stands out as a representative of the
state-of-the-art in the field, and falls within the interest of current and
future experimental collaborations involved in DM indirect detection programs.","[{'name': 'Mihael Petac'}, {'name': 'Piero Ullio'}, {'name': 'Mauro Valli'}]","31 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

$a(t)$ is assumed to obey the `background' Friedmann equation for a perfectly
homogeneous universe while particles move according to equations of motions
driven by the gravity of the density fluctuations. It has recently been
suggested that the emergence of structure modifies the evolution of $a(t)$ via
Newtonian (or `kinematic') backreaction and that this may avoid the need for
dark energy. Here we point out that the conventional system of equations is
exact in Newtonian gravity and there is no approximation in the use of the
homogeneous universe equation for $a(t)$. The recently proposed modification of
Racz et al.\ (2017) does not reduce to Newtonian gravity in the limit of low
velocities. We discuss the relation of this to the `generalised Friedmann
equation' of Buchert and Ehlers. These are quite different things; their
formula describes individual regions and is obtained under the restrictive
assumption that the matter behaves like a pressure-free fluid whereas our
result is exact for collisionless dynamics and is an auxiliary relation
appearing in the structure equations. We use the symmetry of the general
velocity autocorrelation function to show how Buchert's $\cal Q$ tends very
rapidly to zero for large volume and that this does not simply arise `by
construction' through the adoption of periodic boundary conditions as has been
claimed. We conclude that, to the extent that Newtonian gravity accurately
describes the low-$z$ universe, there is no backreaction of structure on $a(t)$
and that the need for dark energy cannot be avoided in this way.",{'name': 'Nick Kaiser'},"6 pages, 0 figures. Substantially revised in response to reviewer's

using the power-enhanced F-test and the nested-ANOVA tests, along with their
spectral behavior. We find significant intraday variability in the single FSRQ
in our sample, having an amplitude of variation ~12%. Although a few of BL Lacs
showed probable variation in some nights, none of them passes the variability
tests at 99.9% significance level. We find that 78% of the sample showed
significant negative colour--magnitude correlations i.e., a
redder-when-brighter spectral evolution. Those which do not show strong or
clear chromatism, predominantly exhibit a redder-when-brighter trends. Unlike
on hourly timescales, the high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazars in the sample
(BZGJ0656+4237, BZGJ0152+0147 and BZBJ1728+5013) show strong flux variation on
days to months timescales, where again we detect a decreasing trend of the
spectral slope with brightness. We observe a global steepening of the optical
spectrum with increasing flux on intranight timescale for the entire blazar
sample. Non-variability in the BL Lacs in our sample could be resulted by
distinct contribution from the disk as well as from other components in the
studied energy range.","[{'name': 'Nibedita Kalita'}, {'name': 'Alok C. Gupta'}, {'name': 'Minfeng Gu'}]","19 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables; accepted for publication in The

gravitational collapse. A compact star is treated as a complete degenerate
Fermi gas of neutrons, protons and electrons. In gravitational collapse, its
density reaches the thresholds for muon and pion productions, leading to
high-energy neutrinos production. By using adiabatic approximation that
macroscopic collapsing processes are much slower than microscopic processes of
particle interactions, we adopt equilibrium equations of microscopic processes
to obtain the number of neutrino productions. Assuming 10% of variation in
gravitational binding energy converted to the energy of produced neutrinos, we
obtain fluxes of 10MeV electron-neutrinos and GeV electron and muon neutrinos.
In addition, we compute the ratio (< 1) of total muon neutrino number to the
total electron neutrino number at the source and at the Earth considering
neutrino oscillations. We approximately obtain the number of GeV antineutrino
events (\gtrsim 1) in an ordinary detector such as Kamiokande and total energy

effect of dynamical friction on a test object only slightly more massive than
the field stars, orbiting a spherically symmetric background of particles with
a mass spectrum. The main goal is to verify whether the dynamical friction time
(t_DF) develops a non-monotonic radial-dependence that could explain the
bimodality of the Blue Straggler radial distributions observed in globular
clusters. In these systems, in fact, relaxation effects lead to a mass and
velocity radial segregation of the different mass components, so that
mass-spectrum effects on t_DF are expected to be dependent on radius. We find
that, in spite of the presence of different masses, t_DF is always a monotonic
function of radius, at all evolutionary times and independently of the initial
concentration of the simulated cluster. This because the radial dependence of
t_DF is largely dominated by the total mass density profile of the background
stars (which is monotonically decreasing with radius). Hence, a progressive
temporal erosion of the BSS population at larger and larger distances from the
cluster center remains the simplest and the most likely explanation of the
shape of the observed BSS radial distributions, as suggested in previous works.
We also confirm the theoretical expectation that approximating a multi-mass
globular cluster as made of (averaged) equal-mass stars can lead to significant
overestimates of t_DF within the half-mass radius.","[{'name': 'Emiliano Alessandrini', 'affiliation': '1 DIFA, Univ. of Bologna'}, {'name': 'Barbara Lanzoni', 'affiliation': '1 DIFA, Univ. of Bologna'}, {'name': 'Paolo Miocchi', 'affiliation': '1 DIFA, Univ. of Bologna'}, {'name': 'Luca Ciotti', 'affiliation': '1 DIFA, Univ. of Bologna'}, {'name': 'Francesco R.

  J band images around the z=6.3 quasar SDSS J1030+0524","Many cosmological studies predict that early supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
can only form in the most massive dark matter halos embedded within large scale
structures marked by galaxy over-densities that may extend up to 10 physical
Mpc. This scenario, however, has not been confirmed observationally, as the
search for galaxy over-densities around high-z quasars has returned conflicting
results. The field around the z=6.28 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524 (J1030) is unique
for multi-band coverage and represents an excellent data legacy for studying
the environment around a primordial SMBH. In this paper we present wide-area
(25x25 arcmin), Y- and J-band imaging of the J1030 field obtained with the near
infrared camera WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We built
source catalogues in the Y- and J-band, and matched those with our photometric
catalogue in the r, z, i bands presented in Morselli et al. (2014). We used
these new infrared data together with H and K and Spitzer/IRAC data to refine
our selection of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), extending our selection criteria
to galaxies in the range 25.2<zAB<25.7. We selected 21 robust high-z candidates
in the J1030 field with photometric redshift around 6 and colors i-z>=1.3. We
found a significant asymmetry in the distribution of the high-z galaxies in
J1030, supporting the existence of a coherent large-scale structure around the
quasar. We compared our results with those of Bowler et al. (2015), who adopted
similar LBGs selection criteria, and estimated an over-density of galaxies in
the field of delta = 2.4, which is significant at >4 sigma. The over-density
value and its significance are higher than those found in Morselli et al.

  high noon","Future dark energy experiments will require better and more accurate
theoretical predictions for the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) signature
in the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. Here, we use large N-body
simulations of the \LambdaCDM Planck cosmology to study any possible systematic
shifts and damping in BAO due to the impact of nonlinear gravitational growth
of structure, scale dependent and non-local bias, and redshift-space
distortions. The effect of cosmic variance is largely reduced by dividing the
tracer power spectrum by that from a BAO-free simulation starting with the same
phases. This permits us to study with unprecedented accuracy (better than 0.02%
for dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos) small shifts of the pristine BAO
wavenumbers towards larger k, and non-linear damping of BAO wiggles in the
power spectrum of dark matter and halo populations in the redshift range z=0-1.
For dark matter, we provide an accurate parametrization of the evolution of
\alpha as a function of the linear growth factor D(z). For halo samples, with
bias ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, we measure a typical BAO shift of ~0.25%,
observed in real-space, which does not show an appreciable evolution with
redshift within the uncertainties. Moreover, we report a constant shift as a
function of halo bias. We find a different evolution of the damping of the
acoustic feature in all halo samples as compared to dark matter with haloes
suffering less damping, and also find some weak dependence on bias. A larger
BAO shift and damping is measured in redshift-space which can be well explained
by linear theory due to redshift-space distortions. A clear modulation in phase
with the acoustic scale is observed in the scale-dependent halo bias due to the
presence of the baryonic acoustic oscillations.","[{'name': 'Francisco Prada'}, {'name': 'Claudia G. Scoccola'}, {'name': 'Chia-Hsun Chuang'}, {'name': 'Gustavo Yepes'}, {'name': 'Anatoly A.

  envelope depletion rates","Motivated by a considerable scatter in the observationally inferred lifetimes
of the embedded phase of star formation, we study the duration of the Class 0
and Class I phases in upper-mass brown dwarfs and low-mass stars using
numerical hydrodynamics simulations of the gravitational collapse of a large
sample of cloud cores. We resolve the formation of a star/disk/envelope system
and extend our numerical simulations to the late accretion phase when the
envelope is nearly totally depleted of matter. We adopted a classification
scheme of Andre et al. and calculate the lifetimes of the Class 0 and Class I
phases (\tau_C0 and \tau_CI, respectively) based on the mass remaining in the
envelope. When cloud cores with various rotation rates, masses, and sizes (but
identical otherwise) are considered, our modeling reveals a sub-linear
correlation between the Class 0 lifetimes and stellar masses in the Class 0
phase with the least-squares fit exponent m=0.8 \pm 0.05. The corresponding
correlation between the Class I lifetimes and stellar masses in the Class I is
super-linear with m=1.2 \pm 0.05. If a wider sample of cloud cores is
considered, which includes possible variations in the initial gas temperature,
cloud core truncation radii, density enhancement amplitudes, initial gas
density and angular velocity profiles, and magnetic fields, then the
corresponding exponents may decrease by as much as 0.3. The duration of the
Class I phase is found to be longer than that of the Class~0 phase in most
models, with a mean ratio \tau_CI / \tau_C0 \approx 1.5--2. A notable exception
are YSOs that form from cloud cores with large initial density enhancements, in
which case \tau_C0 may be greater than \tau_CI. Moreover, the upper-mass (>=
1.0 Msun) cloud cores with frozen-in magnetic fields and high cloud core
rotation rates may have the \tau_CI / \tau_C0 ratios as large as 3.0--4.0.

extended atmosphere that dwarfs its own host star. Predictions of atmospheric
escape in such planets state that H atoms escape from the upper atmosphere in a
collisional regime and that the flow can drag heavier atoms to the upper
atmosphere. It is unclear, however, what astrophysical mechanisms drive the
process. Our objective is to leverage the extensive coverage of HST/COS
observations of the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of GJ 436 to search for
signals of metallic ions in the upper atmosphere of GJ 436 b. We analyzed flux
time-series of species present in the FUV spectrum of GJ 436, as well as the
Lyman-$\alpha$ line. GJ 436 displays FUV flaring events with a rate of $\sim$10
d$^{-1}$. There is evidence for a possibly long-lived active region or
longitude that modulates the FUV metallic lines of the star with amplitudes up
to 20%. Despite the strong geocoronal contamination in the COS spectra, we
detected in-transit excess absorption signals of $\sim$50% and $\sim$30% in the
blue and red wings, respectively, of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. We rule out a
wide range of excess absorption levels in the metallic lines of the star during
the transit. The large atmospheric loss of GJ 436 b observed in Lyman-$\alpha$
transmission spectra is stable over the timescale of a few years, and the red
wing signal supports the presence of a variable hydrogen absorption source
besides the stable exosphere. The previously claimed in-transit absorption in
the Si III line is likely an artifact resulting from the stellar magnetic
cycle. The non-detection of metallic ions in absorption could indicate that the
escape is not hydrodynamic or that the atmospheric mixing is not efficient in
dragging metals high enough for sublimation to produce a detectable escape rate
of ions to the exosphere.","[{'name': 'L. A. dos Santos'}, {'name': 'D. Ehrenreich'}, {'name': 'V. Bourrier'}, {'name': 'A. Lecavelier des Etangs'}, {'name': 'M. López-Morales'}, {'name': 'D. K.

observations of PSR B0943+10, with the goal of better illuminating the nature
of its enigmatic mode-switching behaviour. This pulsar shows two relatively
stable states: a Bright (B) and Quiet (Q) mode, each with different
characteristic brightness, profile morphology, and single-pulse properties. We
model the average profile evolution both in frequency and time from the onset
of each mode, and highlight the differences between the two modes. In both
modes, the profile evolution can be well explained by radius-to-frequency
mapping at altitudes within a few hundred kilometres of the stellar surface. If
both B and Q-mode emission originate at the same magnetic latitude, then we
find that the change of emission height between the modes is less than 6%. We
also find that, during B-mode, the average profile is gradually shifting
towards later spin phase and then resets its position at the next Q-to-B
transition. The observed B-mode profile delay is frequency-independent (at
least from 25-80 MHz) and asymptotically changes towards a stable value of
about 0.004 in spin phase by the end of mode instance, much too large to be due
to changing spin-down rate. Such a delay can be interpreted as a gradual
movement of the emission cone against the pulsar's direction of rotation, with
different field lines being illuminated over time. Another interesting
explanation is a possible variation of accelerating potential inside the polar
gap. This explanation connects the observed profile delay to the gradually
evolving subpulse drift rate, which depends on the gradient of the potential
across the field lines.","[{'name': 'A. Bilous'}, {'name': 'J. Hessels'}, {'name': 'V. Kondratiev'}, {'name': 'J. Leeuwen'}, {'name': 'B. Stappers'}, {'name': 'P. Weltevrede'}, {'name': 'H.

  diffuse molecular clouds of the interstellar medium","We present a theoretical calculation of the influence of ultraviolet
radiative pumping on the excitation of the rotational levels of the ground
vibrational state for HD molecules under conditions of the cold diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM). Two main excitation mechanisms have been taken into
account in our analysis: (i) collisions with atoms and molecules and (ii)
radiative pumping by the interstellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation field. The
calculation of the radiative pumping rate coefficients $\Gamma_{\rm ij}$
corresponding to Drane's model of the field of interstellar UV radiation,
taking into account the self-shielding of HD molecules, is performed. We found
that the population of the first HD rotational level ($J = 1$) is determined
mainly by radiative pumping rather than by collisions if the thermal gas
pressure $p_{\rm
th}\le10^4\left(\frac{I_{\rm{UV}}}{1}\right)\,\mbox{K\,cm}^{-3}$ and the column
density of HD is lower than $\log N({\rm{HD}})<15$. Under this constraint the
populations of rotational levels of HD turns out to be as well a more sensitive
indicator of the UV radiation intensity than the fine-structure levels of
atomic carbon. We suggest that taking into account radiative pumping of HD
rotational levels may be important for the problem of the cooling of primordial
gas at high redshift: ultraviolet radiation from first stars can increase the
rate of HD cooling of the primordial gas in the early Universe.","[{'name': 'V. V. Klimenko'}, {'name': 'A. V.

radar will track space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) up to 1000 km and at the
same time the telescope will also have LEO tracking capabilities. This article
intends to discuss possible ways to take advantage of having these two sensors
at the same location. Using both types of sensors takes advantage of the radar
measurements which give precise radial velocity and distance to the objects,
while the telescope gives better sky coordinates measurements. With the
installation of radar and optical sensors, PASO can extend observation time of
space debris and correlate information from optical and radar provenances in
real time. During twilight periods both sensors can be used simultaneously to
rapidly compute new TLEs for LEO objects, eliminating the time delays involved
in data exchange between sites in a large SST network. This concept will not
replace the need for a SST network with sensors in multiple locations around
the globe, but will provide a more complete set of measurements from a given
object passage, and therefore increase the added value for initial orbit
determination, or monitoring of reentry campaigns of a given location. PASO
will contribute to the development of new solutions to better characterize the
objects improving the overall SST capabilities and constitute a perfect site
for the development and testing of new radar and optical data fusion algorithms
and techniques for space debris monitoring.","[{'name': 'Bruno Coelho'}, {'name': 'Domingos Barbosa'}, {'name': 'Miguel Bergano'}, {'name': 'João Pandeirada'}, {'name': 'Paulo Marques'}, {'name': 'Alexandre C.

admissible range of lengths in nature: from, say, atoms to clusters of galaxies
i.e. from micro to macrocosms. According to current cosmological theories,
galaxies are embedded within massive non-baryonic dark matter (DM) halos, which
affects their formation and evolution. It is therefore highly rewarding to
understand the role of tidal interaction between the dark and luminous matter
in galaxies. The current investigation is devoted to Early-Type Galaxies
(ETGs), looking in particular at the possibility of establishing whether the
tidal interaction of the DM halo with the luminous baryonic component may be at
the origin of the so-called ""tilt"" of the Fundamental Plane (FP). The extension
of the tensor virial theorem to two-component matter distributions implies the
calculation of the self potential energy due to a selected subsystem, and the
tidal potential energy induced by the other one. The additional assumption of
homeoidally striated density profiles allows analytical expressions of the
results for some cases of astrophysical interest. The current investigation
raises from the fact that the profile of the (self + tidal) potential energy of
the inner component shows maxima and minima, suggesting the possible existence
of preferential scales for the virialized structure, i.e. a viable explanation
of the so called ""tilt"" of the FP. It is found that configurations related to
the maxima do not suffice, by themselves, to interpret the FP tilt, and some
other relation has to be looked for.","[{'name': 'T. Valentinuzzi'}, {'name': 'R. Caimmi'}, {'name': ""M. D'Onofrio""}]","Article in Book ""Energy Research Developments: Tidal Energy, Energy

of features with central pits and radial troughs which are thought to be
associated with the solid state greenhouse effect under a CO$_{2}$ ice sheet.
Sublimation at the base of this ice leads to gas buildup, fracturing of the ice
and the flow of gas and entrained regolith out of vents and onto the surface.
There are two possible pathways for the gas: through the gap between the ice
slab and the underlying regolith, as proposed by Kieffer et al (2007), or
through the pores of a permeable regolith layer, which would imply that
regolith properties can control the spacing between adjacent spiders, as
suggested by Hao et al. We test this hypothesis quantitatively in order to
place constraints on the regolith properties. Based on previously estimated
flow rates and thermophysical arguments, we suggest that there is insufficient
depth of porous regolith to support the full gas flow through the regolith. By
contrast, free gas flow through a regolith--ice gap is capable of supplying the
likely flow rates for gap sizes on the order of a centimetre. This size of gap
can be opened in the centre of a spider feature by gas pressure bending the
overlying ice slab upwards, or by levitating it entirely as suggested in the
original Kieffer et al (2007) model. Our calculations therefore support at
least some of the gas flowing through a gap opened between the regolith and
ice. Regolith properties most likely still play a role in the evolution of
spider morphology, by regolith cohesion controlling the erosion of the central
pit and troughs, for example.","[{'name': 'Nicholas Attree'}, {'name': 'Erkia Kaufmann'}, {'name': 'Axel Hagermann'}]",Accepted in Icarus,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12641v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114355', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12641v1']",astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114355,

  modeling of the UVS occultations","The Voyager 1 and 2 Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) solar and stellar
occultation dataset represents one of the primary, pre-Cassini sources of
information that we have on the neutral upper atmosphere of Saturn. Despite its
importance, however, the full set of occultations has never received a
consistent, nor complete, analysis, and the results derived from the initial
analyses over thirty years ago left questions about the temperature and density
profiles unanswered. We have reanalyzed all six of the UVS occultations (three
solar and three stellar) to provide an up-to-date, pre-Cassini view of Saturn's
upper atmosphere. From the Voyager UVS data, we have determined vertical
profiles for H2, H, CH4, C2H2 , C2H4, and C2H6, as well as temperature. Our
analysis also provides explanations for the two different thermospheric
temperatures derived in earlier analyses (400-450 K versus 800 K) and for the
unusual shape of the total density profile noted by Hubbard et al. (1997).
Aside from inverting the occultation data to retrieve densities and
temperatures, we have investigated the atmospheric structure through a series
of photochemical models to infer the strength of atmospheric mixing and other
physical and chemical properties of Saturn's mesopause region during the
Voyager flybys. We find that the data exhibit considerable variability in the
vertical profiles for methane, suggesting variations in vertical winds or the
eddy diffusion coefficient as a function of latitude and/or time in Saturn's
upper atmosphere. The results of our reanalysis will provide a useful baseline

  collisionless equilibrium","(Abridged) We describe a new iterative approach for the realization of
equilibrium N-body systems for given density distributions. Our method uses
elements of Schwarzschild's technique and of the made-to-measure method, but is
based on a different principle. Starting with some initial assignment of
particle velocities, we calculate their orbits using a flexible tree-based
force algorithm in the stationary potential of the target density distribution.
The difference of the time-averaged density response produced by these orbits
with respect to the initial density configuration is characterized through a
merit function, and a stationary solution of the collisionless Boltzmann
equation is found by minimizing this merit function directly by iteratively
adjusting the initial velocities. Because the distribution function is in
general not unique for a given density structure, we augment the merit function
with additional constraints that single out a desired target solution. We do
this for broad classes of axisymmetric density distributions by numerically
solving the Jeans equations to obtain the second velocity moments, which are
then imposed as further constraints in the optimization process. The velocity
adjustment is carried out with a stochastic process in which new velocities are
randomly drawn from an approximate solution of the distribution function, but
are kept only when they improve the fit. Our method converges rapidly and is
flexible enough to allow the construction of solutions with third integrals of
motion, including disk galaxies with realistic velocity distributions. We
demonstrate that the new method reproduces analytic distribution functions
where they are known (such as the Hernquist sphere), and that it yields very
stable N-body realizations for a variety of examples of compound galaxy models,
considerably improving on widely used moment-based approaches.","[{'name': 'Denis Yurin'}, {'name': 'Volker Springel'}]","18 pages, 15 figures, 1 table. Accepted by MNRAS. Minor changes from

hole systems, the two black holes can eject VLBI components in which case two
families of different VLBI trajectories will be observed. Another important
consequence of a binary black hole system is that the VLBI core is associated
with one black hole, and if a VLBI component is ejected by the second black
hole, one expects to be able to detect the offset of the origin of the VLBI
component ejected by the black hole that is not associated with the VLBI core.
The ejection of VLBI components is perturbed by the precession of the accretion
disk and the motion of the black holes around the center of gravity of the
binary black hole system. We modeled the ejection of the component taking into
account the two pertubations and present a method to fit the coordinates of a
VLBI component and to deduce the characteristics of the binary black hole
system. Specifically, this is the ratio Tp/Tb where Tp is the precession period
of the accretion disk and Tb is the orbital period of the binary black hole
system, the mass ratio M1/M2, and the radius of the Binary Black Hole system
Rbin. From the variations of the coordinates as a function of time of the
ejected VLBI component, we estimated the inclination angle io and the bulk
Lorentz factor gamma of the modeled component. We applied the method to
component S1 of 1823+568 and to component C5 of 3C 279.","[{'name': 'J. Roland'}, {'name': 'S. Britzen'}, {'name': 'A. Caproni'}, {'name': 'C. Fromm'}, {'name': 'C. Glück'}, {'name': 'A. Zensus'}]","24 pages, 34 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &

sculpting the large-scale architecture of the solar system, intertwining the
narrative of Jovian early years with the broader story of the solar system's
origins. The details and chronology of Jupiter's formation, however, remain
elusive, primarily due to the inherent uncertainties of accretionary models,
highlighting the need for independent constraints. Here we show that by
analyzing the dynamics of Jupiter's satellites concurrently with its angular
momentum budget, we can infer Jupiter's radius and interior state at the time
of proto-solar nebula's dissipation. In particular, our calculations reveal
that Jupiter was $2$ to $2.5$ times as large as it is today, 3.8 million years
after the formation of the first solids in the solar system. Our model further
indicates that young Jupiter possessed a magnetic field of approximately
$B_{\rm{J}}^{\dagger} \approx 21$ mT (a factor of $\sim50$ higher than its
present-day value) and was accreting material through a circum-Jovian disk at a
rate of $\dot{M} = 1.2-2.4$ Jupiter masses per million years. Our findings are
fully consistent with the core-accretion theory of giant planet formation and
provide an evolutionary snapshot that pins down properties of the Jovian system

distribution function is automatically fitted to observational data for the
solar neighbourhood. We adopt a gravitational potential that is generated by
three discs (gas and both thin and thick stellar discs), a bulge and a dark
halo, and fit the thin-disc component of the distribution function to the
solar-neighbourhood velocity distribution from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey. We
find that the disc's vertical density profile is in good agreement with data at
z<~500 pc. The thick-disc component of the distribution function is then used
to extend the fit to data from Gilmore & Reid (1983) for z<~2.5 kpc. The
resulting model predicts excellent fits to the profile of the vertical velocity
dispersion \sigma_z(z) from the RAVE survey and to the distribution of v_\phi
velocity components at |z|~1kpc from the SDSS survey. The ability of this model
to predict successfully data that was not used in the fitting process suggests
that the adopted gravitational potential (which is close to a maximum-disc
potential) is close to the true one. We show that if another plausible
potential is used, the predicted values of \sigma_z are too large. The models
imply that in contrast to the thin disc, the thick disc has to be hotter
vertically than radially, a prediction that it will be possible to test in the
near future. When the model parameters are adjusted in an unconstrained manner,
there is a tendency to produce models that predict unexpected radial variations
in quantities such as scale height. This finding suggests that to constrain
these models adequately one needs data that extends significantly beyond the

orbit around a moderately active F-type main-sequence star (CoRoT-Exo-4a). This
planetary system is of particular interest because it has an orbital period of

We study the surface rotation and the activity of the host star during an

based on a maximum entropy spot modelling technique extensively tested by
modelling the variation of the total solar irradiance. It assumes that stellar
active regions consist of cool spots and bright faculae, analogous to sunspots
and solar photospheric faculae, whose visibility is modulated by stellar
rotation. The modelling of the light curve of CoRoT-Exo-4a reveals three main
active longitudes with lifetimes between about 30 and 60 days that rotate
quasi-synchronously with the orbital motion of the planet. The different
rotation rates of the active longitudes are interpreted in terms of surface
differential rotation and a lower limit of 0.057 \pm 0.015 is derived for its
relative amplitude. The enhancement of activity observed close to the

  we see the inner disk?","Strong evidence is emerging that winds can be driven from the central regions
of accretion disks in both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and Galactic black hole
binaries (GBHBs). Direct evidence for highly-ionized, Compton-thin inner-disk
winds comes from observations of blueshifted (v~0.05-0.1c) iron-K X-ray
absorption lines. However, it has been suggested that the inner regions of
black hole accretion disks can also drive Compton-thick winds --- such winds
would enshroud the inner disk, preventing us from seeing direct signatures of
the accretion disk (i.e. the photospheric thermal emission, or the
Doppler/gravitationally broadened iron K-alpha line). Here, we show that,
provided the source is sub-Eddington, the well-established wind driving
mechanisms fail to launch a Compton-thick wind from the inner disk. For the
accelerated region of the wind to be Compton-thick, the momentum carried in the
wind must exceed the available photon momentum by a factor of at least
2/lambda, where lambda is the Eddington ratio of the source, ruling out
radiative acceleration unless the source is very close to the Eddington limit.
Compton-thick winds also carry large mass-fluxes, and a consideration of the
connections between the wind and the disk show this to be incompatible with
magneto-centrifugal driving. Finally, thermal driving of the wind is ruled out
on the basis of the large Compton-radii that typify black hole systems. In the
absence of some new acceleration mechanism, we conclude that the inner regions
of sub-Eddington accretion disks around black holes are indeed naked.","{'name': 'Christopher S. Reynolds', 'affiliation': 'Maryland'}","5 pages, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal

belonging to the Southern Taurid Complex of meteor showers between October 27
and November 17, 2015. At the same time, the Cameras for Allsky Meteor
Surveillance project detected a distinct population of smaller meteors
belonging to the irregular IAU shower #628, the s-Taurids. While this returning
outburst was predicted and observed in previous work, the reason for this
stream is not yet understood. 2015 was the first year that the stream was
precisely observed, providing an opportunity to better understand its nature.
We analyse the orbital elements of stream members, and establish a size
frequency distribution from millimetre to metre size range.
  The stream is highly stratified with a large change of entry speed along
Earth's orbit. We confirm that the meteoroids have orbital periods near the 7:2
mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. The mass distribution of this population is
dominated by larger meteoroids, unlike that for the regular Southern Taurid
shower. The distribution index is consistent with a gentle collisional
fragmentation of weak material.
  A population of metre-sized objects is identified from satellite observations
at a rate consistent with a continuation of the size-frequency distribution

  Diffraction-limited spectro-imaging from 7.76 to 19.50 microns with VLT/VISIR","Context: Mass-loss occurring in red supergiants (RSGs) is a major contributor
to the enrichment of the interstellar medium in dust and molecules. The
physical mechanism of this mass loss is however relatively poorly known.
Betelgeuse is the nearest RSG, and as such a prime object for high angular
resolution observations of its surface (by interferometry) and close
circumstellar environment. Aims: The goal of our program is to understand how
the material expelled from Betelgeuse is transported from its surface to the
interstellar medium, and how it evolves chemically in this process. Methods: We
obtained diffraction-limited images of Betelgeuse and a PSF calibrator
(Aldebaran) in six filters in the N band (7.76 to 12.81 mic) and two filters in
the Q band (17.65 and 19.50 mic), using the VLT/VISIR instrument. Results: Our
images show a bright, extended and complex circumstellar envelope at all
wavelengths. It is particularly prominent longwards of 9-10 mic, pointing at
the presence of O-rich dust, such as silicates or alumina. A partial circular
shell is observed between 0.5 and 1.0"" from the star, and could correspond to
the inner radius of the dust envelope. Several knots and filamentary structures
are identified in the nebula, one of the knots, located at a distance of 0.9""
west of the star, being particularly bright and compact. Conclusions: The
circumstellar envelope around Betelgeuse extends at least up to several tens of
stellar radii. Its relatively high degree of clumpiness indicates an
inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the material lost by the star. Its
extension corresponds to an important intermediate scale, where most of the
dust is probably formed, between the hot and compact gaseous envelope observed
previously in the near infrared and the interstellar medium.","[{'name': 'Pierre Kervella', 'affiliation': 'LESIA'}, {'name': 'Guy Perrin', 'affiliation': 'LESIA'}, {'name': 'Andrea Chiavassa', 'affiliation': 'NOAO'}, {'name': 'Stephen T.

  Sample of Fermi Blazars","We present the results of studying the accretion disk vs jet power for a
large fraction of all the blazars detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space
Telescope. The disk power is inferred from the emission line luminosities
obtained from published results. As indicators of jet power, we use low
frequency radio luminosity from the extended jet, maximum speed of radio knots
observed in the VLBA monitoring of the pc-scale jets, kinetic energy of
electrons in the jet deduced from the best-fit theoretical models of their
spectral energy distribution, and gamma-ray luminosity with and without beaming
correction. We obtain a significant correlation in most of those cases.
However, we find that the correlations are often driven by the common redshift
dependence of the compared quantities. In order to remove the redshift bias and
probe the intrinsic correlation between the disk and jet power, we compute the
partial correlation coefficient as well as the correlation in small redshift
bins, and find that the intrinsic disk-jet correlation is still present but
weaker. In the cases, in which the common redshift dependence does not affect
the result, we find that blazars do not exhibit high jet power for low disk
luminosities while there are both high and low jet power for high disk
luminosities. This result indicates that a powerful disk is a necessary but not
sufficient condition to produce a powerful jet.","[{'name': 'Garima Rajguru', 'affiliation': 'Presidency U. Kolkata'}, {'name': 'Ritaban Chatterjee', 'affiliation': 'Presidency U. Kolkata'}]","11 pages, 5 figures, Published in Physical Review D in the 15

Observat\'orio Nacional/MCTI. This instrument is designed to monitor changes on
the solar diameter with the accuracy of the next-generation solar satellites. A
review of the heliometric method is made and the building and testing of 4
prototypes is described. The instrument has a mirror objective split in
dihedral, formed by the hemi-sections of a parabolic mirror. The materials that
form the instrument have thermal and mechanical stability to 10^(-7). The
number of optical parts is minimized and their quality is greater than
{\lambda}/12. An original software for the automated collection and analysis of
the images was developed. With its latest version fully developed, we conducted
an observational campaign of 9 days, deriving more than 70000 heliometric
images of the Sun. The measured solar diameter has a standard deviation of 0.5
arcseconds, with no instrumental bias, and limited only by the provisional
atmospheric modeling. Therefore, by improving the statistics, an accuracy at
milliarcseconds can be achieved. A study of the correlation between the solar
diameter and the geomagnetic field intensity was made. A correspondence between
the peaks of the series related to solar activity, namely, the semidiameter
variation, the flares index, and the sunspots counts, and the number of
negative peaks on the intensity of the geomagnetic field is found. It must be
cautioned though that it is a complex correspondence, requiring different modes
of response and phase dependence on the stage of the cycle of solar activity.
The straightforward interpretation of observational evidence indicates that the
semidiameter of the Sun seems to vary significantly prior to the corresponding
variations of the geomagnetic field. The effect is most evident in the downward
phase of the solar cycle.",{'name': 'Eugênio Reis Neto'},"247 pages, 320 figures. PhD thesis in Geophysics, Observat\'orio

Phoenix} cluster's central galaxy is $\sim 500$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Even
though {\it Phoenix} is a massive cluster ($M_{200} \approx 2.0\times 10^{15}$
M$_\odot$; $z\approx 0.6$) such a high central SFR is not expected in a
scenario in which feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) maintains the
intracluster medium (ICM) in a state of rough thermal balance. It has been
argued that either AGN feedback saturates in very massive clusters or the
central supermassive black hole (SMBH) is too small to produce enough kinetic
feedback and hence is unable to quench the catastrophic cooling. In this work,
we present an alternate scenario wherein intense short-lived cooling and star
formation phases followed by strong AGN outbursts are part of the AGN feedback
loop. Using results from a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of a standard cool-core
cluster ($M_{200}\sim 7\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$; $z=0$), scaled to account for
differences in mass and redshift, we argue that {\it Phoenix} is at the end of
a cooling phase in which an AGN outburst has begun but has not yet arrested
core cooling. This state of high cooling rate and star formation is expected to
last for $\lesssim$ 100 Myr in {\it Phoenix}.","[{'name': 'Deovrat Prasad'}, {'name': 'Prateek Sharma'}, {'name': 'Arif Babul'}, {'name': 'G. Mark Voit'}, {'name': ""Brian W.

  Supernovae","Bearing in mind the application to core-collapse supernovae, we study
nonlinear properties of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) by means of
three- dimensional simulations in the framework of a local shearing box
approximation. By changing systematically the shear rates that symbolize the
degree of differential rotation in nascent proto-neutron stars (PNSs), we
derive a scaling relation between the turbulent stress sustained by the MRI and
the shear- vorticity ratio. Our parametric survey shows a power-law scaling
between the turbulent stress ($<< w_{\rm tot}>>$) and the shear- vorticity
ratio ($g_q$) as $<<w_{\rm tot}>> \propto g_q^{\delta}$ with its index $\delta
\sim 0.5$. The MRI-amplified magnetic energy has a similar scaling relative to
the turbulent stress, while the Maxwell stress has slightly smaller power-law
index ($\sim 0.36$). By modeling the effect of viscous heating rates due to the
MRI turbulence, we show that the stronger magnetic fields or the larger shear
rates initially imposed lead to the higher dissipation rates. For a rapidly
rotating PNS with the spin period in milliseconds and with strong magnetic
fields of $10^{15}$ G, the energy dissipation rate is estimated to exceed
$10^{51} {\rm erg\ sec^{-1}}$. Our results suggest that the conventional
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mechanism of core-collapse supernovae is likely to be
affected by the MRI-driven turbulence, which we speculate, on one hand, could
harm the MHD-driven explosions due to the dissipation of the shear rotational
energy at the PNS surface, on the other hand the energy deposition there might
be potentially favorable for the working of the neutrino-heating mechanism.","[{'name': 'Y. Masada'}, {'name': 'T. Takiwaki'}, {'name': 'K. Kotake'}, {'name': 'T.

  Survey","The Jupiter Trojans are a large group of asteroids that are co-orbiting with
Jupiter near its L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The study of Jupiter Trojans is
crucial for testing different models of planet formation that are directly
related to our understanding of solar system evolution. In this work, we select
known Jupiter Trojans listed by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) from the full six
years dataset (Y6) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to analyze their photometric
properties. The DES data allow us to study Jupiter Trojans with a fainter
magnitude limit than previous studies in a homogeneous survey with $griz$ band
measurements. We extract a final catalog of 573 unique Jupiter Trojans. Our
sample include 547 asteroids belonging to L5. This is one of the largest
analyzed samples for this group. By comparing with the data reported by other
surveys we found that the color distribution of L5 Trojans is similar to that
of L4 Trojans. We find that L5 Trojans' $g - i$ and $g - r$ colors become less
red with fainter absolute magnitudes, a trend also seen in L4 Trojans. Both the
L4 and L5 clouds consistently show such a color-size correlation over an
absolute magnitude range $11 < H < 18$. We also use DES colors to perform
taxonomic classifications. C and P-type asteroids outnumber D-type asteroids in

  models, with application to SN 1987A and Cas A","Comparison of theoretical line profiles to observations provides important
tests for supernova explosion models. We study the shapes of radioactive decay
lines predicted by current 3D core-collapse explosion simulations, and compare
these to observations of SN 1987A and Cas A. Both the widths and shifts of
decay lines vary by several thousand kilometers per second depending on viewing
angle. The line profiles can be complex with multiple peaks. By combining
observational constraints from 56Co decay lines, 44Ti decay lines, and Fe IR
lines, we delineate a picture of the morphology of the explosive burning ashes
in SN 1987A. For M_ZAMS=15-20 Msun progenitors exploding with ~1.5 *10^51 erg,
ejecta structures suitable to reproduce the observations involve a bulk
asymmetry of the 56Ni of at least ~400 km/s and a bulk velocity of at least
~1500 km/s. By adding constraints to reproduce the UVOIR bolometric light curve
of SN 1987A up to 600d, an ejecta mass around 14 Msun is favoured. We also
investigate whether observed decay lines can constrain the neutron star (NS)
kick velocity. The model grid provides a constraint V_NS > V_redshift, and
applying this to SN 1987A gives a NS kick of at least 500 km/s. For Cas A, our
single model provides a satisfactory fit to the NuSTAR observations and
reinforces the result that current neutrino-driven core-collapse SN models can
achieve enough bulk asymmetry in the explosive burning material. Finally, we
investigate the internal gamma-ray field and energy deposition, and compare the
3D models to 1D approximations.","[{'name': 'A. Jerkstrand'}, {'name': 'A. Wongwathanarat'}, {'name': 'H. -T. Janka'}, {'name': 'M. Gabler'}, {'name': 'D. Alp'}, {'name': 'R. Diehl'}, {'name': 'K.

been established by many observations over the last two decades. The emerging
explanation for the formation of these giant sources of diffuse synchrotron
radio emission is that they trace turbulent regions in the intracluster medium,

observational knowledge is, however, mainly limited to massive systems. Here we

Parkes survey of the region in order to probe the multiphase structures of the

High-resolution data were obtained from the Australia Telescope Compact Array.
By combining with single-dish data from the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS), we
are able to probe compact and diffuse emission simultaneously. We identify
resolved and unresolved clumps. Physical parameters were derived for both
diffuse structure and compact clumps. The latter are cold with typical velocity
linewidths of 5 km/s. We find a gradient in thermal halo pressure, hydrogen
density and HI column density of HVC as a function of Galactic latitude. This
is possibly the first observational evidence of varying distance in the Leading
Arm region, with the leading part of the Leading Arm (LA II and III) probably
being closer to the Galactic disc than the trailing end (LA I).","[{'name': 'B. Q. For'}, {'name': 'L. Staveley-Smith'}, {'name': 'N. M. McClure-Griffiths'}, {'name': 'T. Westmeier'}, {'name': 'K.

  intermediate massive star clusters","Observations found that star clusters contain a large fraction of binaries.
Tight binaries are an important heating source that influences the long-term
dynamical evolution of star clusters. However, due to the limitation of
$N$-body tool, previous theoretical modelling for globular clusters (GCs) by
using direct $N$-body simulations have not investigated how a large fraction of
primordial binaries affect their long-term evolution. In this work, by using
the high-performance $N$-body code, PeTar, we carry out star-by-star models for
intermediate massive GCs ($N=100000$) with the primordial binary fraction
varying from 0 to 1. We find that when a stellar-mass black hole (BH) subsystem
exists, the structural evolution of GCs (core and half-mass radii) only depends
on the properties of massive primordial binaries, because they affect the
number of BH binaries (BBHs), which dominate the binary heating process.
Low-mass binaries including double white dwarf binaries (BWDs) have almost no
influence on the dynamics. Meanwhile, only gravitational wave (GW) mergers from
BBHs are strongly affected by dynamical interactions, while low-mass mergers
from BWDs show no difference in the isolated environment (field) and in GCs.
Low-mass binaries become important only after most BHs escape and the core
collapse of light stars occurs. Our result suggests that for $N$-body modelling
of GCs with a black hole subsystem dominating binary heating, it is not
necessary to include low-mass binaries. These binaries can be studied
separately by using standalone binary stellar evolution codes. This way can
significantly reduce the computing cost.","[{'name': 'Long Wang', 'affiliation': ['Department of Astronomy, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan', 'RIKEN Center for Computational Science, 7-1-26 Minatojima-minami-machi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0047, Japan']}, {'name': 'Ataru Tanikawa', 'affiliation': 'Department of Earth Science and Astronomy, College of Arts ans Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan'}, {'name': 'Michiko S.

  Microlensing Timescales","We use the timescale distribution of ~3000 microlensing events measured by
the OGLE-III survey, together with accurate new made-to-measure dynamical
models of the Galactic bulge/bar region, to measure the IMF in the inner Milky
Way. The timescale of each event depends on the mass of the lensing object,
together with the relative distances and velocities of the lens and source. The
dynamical model provides statistically these distances and velocities allowing
us to constrain the lens mass function, and from this to infer the IMF.
Parameterising the IMF as a broken power-law, we find slopes in the main
sequence $\alpha_{\rm ms}=1.31\pm0.10|_{\rm stat}\pm0.10|_{\rm sys}$ and brown
dwarf region $\alpha_{\rm bd}=-0.7\pm0.9|_{\rm stat}\pm0.8|_{\rm sys}$ where we
use a fiducial 50% binary fraction, and the systematic uncertainty covers the
range of binary fractions 0-100%. Similarly for a log-normal IMF we conclude
$M_c=(0.17\pm0.02|_{\rm stat}\pm0.01|_{\rm sys})M_\odot$ and
$\sigma_m=0.49\pm0.07|_{\rm stat}\pm0.06|_{\rm sys}$. These values are very
similar to a Kroupa or Chabrier IMF respectively, showing that the IMF in the
bulge is indistinguishable from that measured locally, despite the lenses lying
in the inner Milky Way where the stars are mostly ~10Gyr old and formed on a
fast $\alpha$-element enhanced timescale. This therefore constrains models of
IMF variation that depend on the properties of the collapsing gas cloud.","[{'name': 'Christopher Wegg'}, {'name': 'Ortwin Gerhard'}, {'name': 'Matthieu Portail'}]","6 pages, 3 figures.

martian equator, indicating their formation from a circumplanetary disk. Phobos
is currently migrating toward Mars due to tidal dissipation within the planet,
and may be disrupted into a ring in few tens of Myr. The past evolution of
Phobos is not fully understood, with one possibility being that Phobos formed
in the early Solar System just interior to the synchronous orbit and migrated
inward over several Gyr. Alternatively, Phobos may be the most recent product
of an ongoing martian ring-moon cycle that lasted several Gyr but formed Phobos
only 100 Myr ago at the fluid Roche limit. Here we use numerical integrations
to simulate past evolution of Phobos in both of these scenarios and test
whether Phobos's small eccentricity and inclination are consistent with either
of these hypotheses. During its tidal evolution, Phobos crossed multiple
resonances with both the rotation of Mars and the apparent motion of the Sun,
requiring detailed numerical modeling of these dynamical events. Furthermore,
Phobos crossed resonances with Deimos, which can affect the orbit of Deimos. We
find that both the ancient Phobos hypothesis and the ring-moon cycle are fully
consistent with the present orbit of Phobos, with no currently available means
of distinguishing between these very different dynamical histories.
Furthermore, we find that Deimos is affected by weak chaos caused by secular
resonances with the planetary system, making the eccentricity of Deimos an
ineffective constraint on the past migration of Phobos.","[{'name': 'Matija Ćuk'}, {'name': 'Kaustub P. Anand'}, {'name': 'David A. Minton'}]",Accepted for PSJ,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12691v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12691v1,astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],,

  Transform","We investigate the use of a logarithmic density variable in estimating the
Lagrangian displacement field, motivated by the success of a logarithmic
transformation in restoring information to the matter power spectrum. The
logarithmic relation is an extension of the linear relation, motivated by the
continuity equation, in which the density field is assumed to be proportional
to the divergence of the displacement field; we compare the linear and
logarithmic relations by measuring both of these fields directly in a
cosmological N-body simulation. The relative success of the logarithmic and
linear relations depends on the scale at which the density field is smoothed.
Thus we explore several ways of measuring the density field, including
Cloud-In-Cell smoothing, adaptive smoothing, and the (scale-independent)
Delaunay tessellation, and we use both a Fourier space and a geometrical
tessellation approach to measuring the divergence. We find that the relation
between the divergence of the displacement field and the density is
significantly tighter with a logarithmic density variable, especially at low
redshifts and for very small (~2 Mpc/h) smoothing scales. We find that the
grid-based methods are more reliable than the tessellation-based method of
calculating both the density and the divergence fields, though in both cases
the logarithmic relation works better in the appropriate regime, which
corresponds to nonlinear scales for the grid-based methods and low densities
for the tessellation-based method.","[{'name': 'Bridget L. Falck'}, {'name': 'Mark C. Neyrinck'}, {'name': 'Miguel A. Aragon-Calvo'}, {'name': 'Guilhem Lavaux'}, {'name': 'Alexander S.

made of stars not bound to individual galaxies. We have carried out a large
scale study of this component in the nearby Virgo cluster. The diffuse light is
traced using planetary nebulae (PNe). The PNe are detected in the on-band image
due to their strong emission in the [OIII] 5007 line, but disappear in the
off-band image. The contribution of Ly-alpha emitters at z=3.14 are corrected
statistically using blank field surveys. We have surveyed a total area of 3.3
square degrees in the Virgo cluster with eleven fields located at different
radial distances. Those fields located at smaller radii than 80 arcmin from the
cluster center contain most of the detected diffuse light. In this central
region of the cluster, the ICL has a surface brightness in the range 28.8 - 30
mag per sqarsec in the B band, it is not uniformly distributed, and represents
about 7% of the total galaxy light in this area. At distances larger than 80
arcmin the ICL is confined to single fields and individual sub-structures, e.g.
in the Virgo sub-clump B, the M60/M59 group. For several fields at 2 and 3
degrees from the Virgo cluster center we set only upper limits. These results
indicate that the ICL is not homogeneously distributed in the Virgo core, and
it is concentrated in the high density regions of the Virgo cluster, e.g. the
cluster core and other sub-structures. Outside these regions, the ICL is
confined within areas of 100 kpc in size, where tidal effects may be at work.
These observational results link the formation of the ICL with the formation
history of the most luminous cluster galaxies.","[{'name': 'Nieves Castro-Rodriguez', 'affiliation': 'IAC'}, {'name': 'Magda Arnaboldi', 'affiliation': 'ESO, INAF-OATo'}, {'name': 'J. Alfonso L.

stellar population age as a function of the total stellar mass and morphology
for a sample of 107 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We use the fossil record
to recover the star formation history (SFH) in spheroidal and disk dominated
galaxies with masses from 10$^9$ to 10$^{12}$ M$_\odot$. We derive the half
mass radius, and we find that galaxies are on average 15% more compact in mass
than in light. HMR/HLR decreases with increasing mass for disk galaxies, but is
almost constant in spheroidal galaxies. We find that the galaxy-averaged
stellar population age, stellar extinction, and $\mu$ are well represented by
their values at 1 HLR. Negative radial gradients of the stellar population ages
support an inside-out formation. The larger inner age gradients occur in the
most massive disk galaxies that have the most prominent bulges; shallower age
gradients are obtained in spheroids of similar mass. Disk and spheroidal
galaxies show negative $\mu$ gradients that steepen with stellar mass. In
spheroidal galaxies $\mu$ saturates at a critical value that is independent of
the galaxy mass. Thus, all the massive spheroidal galaxies have similar local
$\mu$ at the same radius (in HLR units). The SFH of the regions beyond 1 HLR
are well correlated with their local $\mu$, and follow the same relation as the
galaxy-averaged age and $\mu$; suggesting that local stellar mass surface
density preserves the SFH of disks. The SFH of bulges are, however, more
fundamentally related to the total stellar mass, since the radial structure of
the stellar age changes with galaxy mass even though all the spheroid dominated
galaxies have similar radial structure in $\mu$. Thus, galaxy mass is a more
fundamental property in spheroidal systems while the local stellar mass surface
density is more important in disks.","[{'name': 'R. M. González Delgado'}, {'name': 'E. Pérez'}, {'name': 'R. Cid Fernandes'}, {'name': 'R. García-Benito'}, {'name': 'A. L. de Amorim'}, {'name': 'S.

  Foundational calibration strategy and pipeline","[abridged] The International LOFAR Telescope is an interferometer with
stations spread across Europe. With baselines of up to ~2,000 km, LOFAR has the
unique capability of achieving sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies below
200 MHz, although this is technically and logistically challenging. Here we
present a calibration strategy that builds on previous high-resolution work
with LOFAR. We give an overview of the calibration strategy and discuss the
special challenges inherent to enacting high-resolution imaging with LOFAR, and
describe the pipeline, which is publicly available, in detail. We demonstrate
the calibration strategy by using the pipeline on P205+55, a typical LOFAR
Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) pointing. We perform in-field delay calibration,
solution referencing to other calibrators, self-calibration, and imaging of
example directions of interest in the field. For this specific field and these
ionospheric conditions, dispersive delay solutions can be transferred between
calibrators up to ~1.5 degrees away, while phase solution transferral works
well over 1 degree. We demonstrate a check of the astrometry and flux density
scale. Imaging in 17 directions, the restoring beam is typically 0.3"" x 0.2""
although this varies slightly over the entire 5 square degree field of view. We
achieve ~80 to 300 $\mu$Jy/bm image rms noise, which is dependent on the
distance from the phase centre; typical values are ~90 $\mu$Jy/bm for the 8
hour observation with 48 MHz of bandwidth. Seventy percent of processed sources
are detected, and from this we estimate that we should be able to image ~900
sources per LoTSS pointing. This equates to ~3 million sources in the northern
sky, which LoTSS will entirely cover in the next several years. Future
optimisation of the calibration strategy for efficient post-processing of LoTSS
at high resolution (LoTSS-HR) makes this estimate a lower limit.","[{'name': 'L. K. Morabito'}, {'name': 'N. J. Jackson'}, {'name': 'S. Mooney'}, {'name': 'F. Sweijen'}, {'name': 'S.

  J1018.6-5856","1FGL J1018.6-5856 is a high mass gamma-ray binary containing a compact object
orbiting around a massive star with a period of 16.544 d. If the compact object
is a pulsar, non-thermal emissions are likely produced by electrons accelerated
at the termination shock, and may also originate from the magnetosphere and the
un-shocked wind of the pulsar. In this paper, we investigate the non-thermal
emissions from the wind and the shock with different viewing geometries and
study the multi-wavelength emissions from 1FGL J1018.6-5856. We present the
analysis results of the \textit{Fermi}/LAT using nearly 10 years of data. The
phase-resolved spectra indicate that the GeV emissions comprise a rather steady
component that does not vary with orbital motion and a modulated component that
shows flux maximum around inferior conjunction. The keV/TeV light curves of
1FGL J1018.6-5856 also exhibit a sharp peak around inferior conjunction, which
are attributed to the boosted emission from the shock, while the broad
sinusoidal modulations could be originating from the deflected shock tail at a
larger distance. The modulations of GeV flux are likely caused by the boosted
synchrotron emission from the shock and the IC emission from the un-shocked
pulsar wind, while the steady component comes from the outer gap of the pulsar
magnetosphere. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences of 1FGL
J1018.6-5856 with other binaries, like LS 5039.","[{'name': 'A. M. Chen'}, {'name': 'C. W. Ng'}, {'name': 'J. Takata'}, {'name': 'Y. W.

elucidate the ion acceleration process. The X8.2 event was a limb flare that
proved adequate for fixing the parameters needed to explain the process of
particle acceleration into high energies. According to our analysis, the
electron acceleration process may possibly be explained by the shock
acceleration model. However, we found that it would be difficult to explain the

preheated prior to their rapid acceleration.","[{'name': 'K. Kamiya'}, {'name': 'K. Koga'}, {'name': 'H. Matsumoto'}, {'name': 'S. Masuda'}, {'name': 'Y. Muraki'}, {'name': 'H. Tajima'}, {'name': 'S. Shibata'}]","submitted to International Conference on Cosmic Ras and Astroparticle

  analyzing the effects of continuum optical depth","In studying the formation of massive stars, it is essential to consider the
strong radiative feedback on the stars' natal environments from their high
luminosities ($10^4 \sim 10^6 L_\odot$). Given that massive stars contract to
main-sequence-like radii before accretion finishes, one form this feedback
takes is UV line-acceleration, resulting in outflows much like those expected
from main-sequence massive stars. As shown by the prior papers in this series,
in addition to driving stellar winds, such line forces also ablate the surface
layers off of circumstellar discs within a few stellar radii of the stellar
photosphere. This removal of material from an accretion disc in turn results in
a decreased accretion rate onto the forming star. Quantifying this, however,
requires accounting for the continuum optical depth of the disc along the
non-radial rays required for the three-dimensional line-acceleration
prescription used in this paper series. We introduce the ""thin disc
approximation"", allowing these continuum optical depths arising from an
optically thick but geometrically thin disc to be dynamically treated in the
context of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Using this approximation in
full dynamical simulations, we show that such continuum optical depth effects
only reduce the disc ablation by 30 percent or less relative to previous
simulations that ignored continuum absorption.","[{'name': 'Nathaniel Kee'}, {'name': 'Stan Owocki'}, {'name': 'Rolf Kuiper'}]","10 pages, 9 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08753v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty1721', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08753v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.1093/mnras/sty1721,

  of Dusty Agglomerates at Velocities Above the Fragmentation Threshold","In the last years, experiments have shown that collisions above the
fragmentation threshold velocity are a potentially important growth process for
protoplanatary dust aggregates. To obtain deeper understanding of this process,
we performed laboratory and drop-tower experiments to study multiple impacts of
small, porous dust-aggregate projectiles onto sintered dust targets. Projectile
and target consisted of 1.5 micron monodisperse, spherical SiO2 monomers with
volume filling factors of 0.15 (projectiles) and 0.45 (targets). The
projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a magazine
with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in
vacuum. We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor
for different impact velocities between 1.5 and 6.0 m/s. The experiments at the
lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop-tower under microgravity
conditions. Within this velocity range we found a linear increase of the
accretion efficiency with increasing velocity. In the laboratory experiments,
the accretion efficiency increases from 0.12 to 0.21 in units of the projectile
mass. The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the
projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the
target. From the images we also measured the volume filling factors of the
grown structures, which ranged from 0.15 (uncompacted) to 0.40 (significantly
compacted) with increasing impact speed. These results augment our knowledge of
the aggregate growth in protoplanetary disks and should be taken into account

as evaluated from n>3 independent distance estimates, and the statistics for
age estimates are markedly worse. That impedes such diverse efforts as
calibrating standard candles and constraining masses for substellar companions.
New data from the VVV survey may be employed to establish precise cluster
distances with comparatively reduced uncertainties (<10%). This is illustrated
by deriving parameters for Pismis 19 and NGC 4349, two pertinent open clusters
which hitherto feature sizable uncertainties (60%). Fundamental parameters
determined for Pismis 19 from new VVV JHKs photometry are d=2.40+-0.15 kpc,

yielded d=1.63+-0.13 kpc, E(J-H)=0.09+-0.02, log(t)=8.55+-0.10. The results
exhibit a significant (>5x) reduction in uncertainties, and indicate that: i)
existing parameters for the substellar object NGC 4349 127b require revision,
in part because the new cluster parameters imply that the host is 20%
less-massive (M*/Ms~3.1); ii) R Cru is not a member of NGC 4349 and should be
excluded from period-Wesenheit calibrations that anchor the distance scale;

and operation of modern ground-based optical telescopes. In particular, the
effective application of adaptive optics correction on large and extremely
large telescopes relies on a detailed knowledge of the prevailing atmospheric
conditions, including the vertical profile of the optical turbulence strength
and the atmospheric coherence timescale. The Differential Image Motion Monitor
(DIMM) has been employed as a facility seeing monitor at many astronomical
observing sites across the world for several decades, providing a reliable
estimate of the seeing angle. Here we present the Shack-Hartmann Image Motion
Monitor (SHIMM), which is a development of the DIMM instrument, in that it
exploits differential image motion measurements of bright target stars.
However, the SHIMM employs a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor in place of the
two-hole aperture mask utilised by the DIMM. This allows the SHIMM to provide
an estimate of the seeing, unbiased by shot noise or scintillation effects. The
SHIMM also produces a low-resolution (three-layer) measure of the vertical
turbulence profile, as well as an estimate of the coherence timescale. The
SHIMM is designed as a low-cost, portable, instrument. It is comprised of
off-the-shelf components so that it is easy to duplicate and well-suited for
comparisons of atmospheric conditions within and between different observing
sites. Here, the SHIMM design and methodology for estimating key atmospheric
parameters will be presented, as well as initial field test results with
comparisons to the Stereo-SCIDAR instrument.","[{'name': 'Saavidra Perera'}, {'name': 'Richard W. Wilson'}, {'name': 'Tim Butterley'}, {'name': 'James Osborn'}, {'name': 'Ollie J. D.

  long-baseline ALMA observations","Transition disks with large inner dust cavities are thought to host massive
companions. However, the disk structure inside the companion orbit and how
material flows toward an actively accreting star remain unclear. We present a
high resolution continuum study of inner disks in the cavities of 38 transition
disks. Measurements of the dust mass from archival Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations are combined with stellar
properties and spectral energy distributions to assemble a detailed picture of
the inner disk. An inner dust disk is detected in 18 of 38 disks in our sample.
Of the 14 resolved disks, 9 are significantly misaligned with the outer disk.
The near-infrared excess is uncorrelated with the mm dust mass of the inner
disk. The size-luminosity correlation known for protoplanetary disks is
recovered for the inner disks as well, consistent with radial drift. The inner
disks are depleted in dust relative to the outer disk and their dust mass is
uncorrelated with the accretion rates. This is interpreted as the result of
radial drift and trapping by planets in a low $\alpha$ ($\sim 10^{-3}$) disk,
or a failure of the $\alpha$-disk model to describe angular momentum transport
and accretion. The only disk in our sample with confirmed planets in the gap,
PDS 70, has an inner disk with a significantly larger radius and lower inferred
gas-to-dust ratio than other disks in the sample. We hypothesize that these
inner disk properties and the detection of planets are due to the gap having
only been opened recently by young, actively accreting planets.","[{'name': 'Logan Francis'}, {'name': 'Nienke van der Marel'}]","31 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical

thousand 3-body integrations and is explained by simple analytic arguments. The
collisions are conservatively restricted to ""clean"" collisions in which all
passages prior to the collision are greater than 4R_WD=4x10^9cm. In particular,
within the last single orbit, the pericenter changes from r_p>4R_WD to a
collision value of r_p<2R_WD. The effects of tidal deformations and General
Relativistic (GR) corrections are negligible in these scenarios. The WDs
approach each other with a high velocity >3000 km/s and the collision is likely
to detonate the WDs leading to a type Ia SNe. If a significant fraction of WDs
reside in such triples, the rate of such collisions is as high as the SNe Ia
rate, and it is possible that some or all type Ia SNe occur in this way. Such
SNe have a unique gravitational wave signature, which will allow a decisive
identification in the future.","[{'name': 'Boaz Katz', 'affiliation': 'IAS'}, {'name': 'Subo Dong', 'affiliation': 'IAS'}]",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4584v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.4584v2,astro-ph.SR,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.HE']",,

parallel Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, to simulate Lyman-$\alpha$
(Ly$\alpha$) resonant scattering through neutral hydrogen as a probe of the
first galaxies. We explore the interaction of centrally produced Ly$\alpha$
radiation with the host galactic environment. Ly$\alpha$ photons emitted from
the luminous starburst region escape with characteristic features in the line
profile depending on the density distribution, ionization structure, and bulk
velocity fields. For example, anisotropic ionization exhibits a tall peak close
to line centre with a skewed tail that drops off gradually. Idealized models of
first galaxies explore the effect of mass, anisotropic H II regions, and
radiation pressure driven winds on Ly$\alpha$ observables. We employ mesh
refinement to resolve critical structures. We also post-process an ab initio
cosmological simulation and examine images captured at various escape distances
within the 1 Mpc$^3$ comoving volume. Finally, we discuss the emergent spectra
and surface brightness profiles of these objects in the context of high-$z$
observations. The first galaxies will likely be observed through the red
damping wing of the Ly$\alpha$ line. Observations will be biased toward
galaxies with an intrinsic red peak located far from line centre that reside in
extensive H II super bubbles, which allows Hubble flow to sufficiently redshift
photons away from line centre and facilitate transmission through the
intergalactic medium (IGM). Even with gravitational lensing to boost the
luminosity this preliminary work indicates that Ly$\alpha$ emission from

  formation from the HiZELS survey","We use the HiZELS narrow-band H-alpha survey in combination with CANDELS,
UKIDSS and WIRDS near-infrared imaging, to investigate the morphologies, merger
rates and sizes of a sample of H-alpha emitting galaxies in the redshift range
z=0.40 - 2.23, an epoch encompassing the rise to the peak of the star formation
rate density. Merger rates are estimated from space- and ground-based imaging
using the M20 coefficient. To account for the increase in the specific
star-formation rate (sSFR) of the star forming `main-sequence' with redshift,
we normalise the star-formation rate of galaxies at each epoch to the typical
value derived from the H-alpha luminosity function. Once this trend in sSFR is
removed we see no evidence for an increase in the number density of
star-forming galaxies or the merger rate with redshift. We thus conclude that
neither is the main driver of the enhanced star-formation rate density at
z=1-2, with secular processes such as instabilities within efficiently fuelled,
gas-rich discs or multiple minor mergers the most likely alternatives. However,
we find that 40-50% of starburst galaxies, those with enhanced specific star
formation at their epoch, are major mergers and this fraction is redshift
independent. Finally, we find the surprising result that the typical size of a
star-forming galaxy of a given mass does not evolve across the redshift range
considered, suggesting a universal size-mass relation. Taken in combination,
these results indicate a star-forming galaxy population that is statistically
similar in physical size, merger rate and mass over the 6 Gyr covered in this
study, despite the increase in typical sSFR.","[{'name': 'John P.

brightest cluster-centre radio galaxies in the sky, Cygnus A, Hercules A and
Hydra A, to search for inverse-Compton emission from the population of
electrons responsible for the low-frequency radio emission. Using simulated
observations, we derive robust estimates for the uncertainties on the
normalization of an inverse-Compton component in the presence of the variations
in background thermal temperature actually seen in our target objects. Using
these, together with the pressures external to the lobes, we are able to place
interesting upper limits on the fraction of the energy density in the lobes of
Hydra A and Her A that can be provided by a population of relativistic
electrons with standard properties, assuming that the magnetic field is not
dominant; these limits are consistent with the long-standing idea that the
energy density in these lobes is dominated by a non-radiating particle
population. In Cygnus A, we find evidence in the spectra for an additional hard
component over and above the expected thermal emission, which is plausibly a
detection of inverse-Compton emission; even in this case, though, some
additional non-radiating particles and/or a departure from our standard
assumptions on the electron spectrum are necessary to allow pressure balance at
the mid-point of the lobes. As this is not the case in other Fanaroff-Riley
class II radio galaxies, we suggest that the rich environment of Cygnus A may
have some effect on its lobe particle content.","[{'name': 'M. J. Hardcastle'}, {'name': 'J. H. Croston'}]","10 pages, 1 figure. Accepted for MNRAS. Updated version provides some

parameters are borrowed from the Crab nebula. The particle spectra produced in
the pulsar wind nebula are then propagated up to the Solar System, using a
diffusion model. Differently from previous works, the omnidirectional intensity
excess for electrons and positrons is obtained as a difference between the
AMS-02 data and the corresponding local interstellar spectrum. An equal amount
of electron and positron excess is observed and we interpreted this excess
(above $\sim$100 GeV in the AMS-02 data) as a supply coming from Vela-X. The
particle contribution is consistent with models predicting the gamma-ray

on the Swift/BAT longterm light curve. Previous observations, though sparse,
have identified the source to be one of only nine known symbiotic X-ray
binaries, i.e., systems composed of an accreting neutron star orbiting in a
highly inhomogeneous medium around an M-giant companion. The spectrum of 3A
1954+319 above 20 keV can be best described by a broken power law model. The
extremely long pulse period of ~5.3 hours is clearly visible in the
INTEGRAL/ISGRI light curve and confirmed through an epoch folding period
search. Furthermore, the light curve allows us to determine a very strong spin
up of -2x10^-4 h/h during the outburst. This spin up is confirmed by the pulse
period evolution calculated from Swift/BAT data. The Swift/BAT data also show a
long spin-down trend prior to the 2008 outburst, which is confirmed in archival
INTEGRAL/ISGRI data. We discuss possible accretion models and geometries
allowing for the transfer of such large amounts of angular momentum and
investigate the harder spectrum of this outburst compared to previously
published results.","[{'name': 'F. Fürst'}, {'name': 'D. M. Marcu'}, {'name': 'K. Pottschmidt'}, {'name': 'V. Grinberg'}, {'name': 'J. Wilms'}, {'name': 'M. Cadolle Bel'}]","6 pages, 3 figures; published online as PoS(INTEGRAL 2010)017,

  using a direct N-body integrator with stellar feedback","One of the computational challenges of cluster formation simulations is
resolving individual stars and simulating massive clusters with masses of more
than $10^4 M_{\odot}$ without gravitational softening. Combining direct
$N$-body code with smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code, we have
developed a new code, \textsc{ASURA+BRIDGE}, in which we can integrate stellar
particles without softening. We add a feedback model for \HII regions into this
code, in which thermal and momentum feedback is given within the Str{\""o}mgren
radius. We perform $N$-body/SPH simulations of star cluster formation. Without
softening, a portion of massive stars are ejected from the forming clusters. As
a result, the stellar feedback works outside the clusters. This
enhances/suppresses the star formation in initially sub-virial/super-virial
clouds. We find that the formed star clusters are denser than currently
observed open clusters, but the mass--density relation is consistent with or
even higher than that is estimated as an initial cluster density. We also find
that some clusters have multiple peaks in their stellar age distribution as a
consequence of their hierarchical formation.","[{'name': 'Michiko S. Fujii'}, {'name': 'Takayuki R.

  QG298","New observations show that the lightcurve of Kuiper belt contact binary
(139775) 2001 QG298 has changed substantially since the first observations in
2003. The 2010 lightcurve has a peak-to-peak photometric of range
\Deltam{2010}=0.7\pm0.1 mag, significantly lower than in 2003,
\Deltam{2003}=1.14\pm0.04 mag. This change is most simply interpreted if 2001
QG298 has an obliquity near 90 deg. The observed decrease in \Deltam is caused
by a change in viewing geometry, from equator-on in 2003 to nearly 16 deg (the
orbital angular distance covered by the object between the observations) off
the equator in 2010. The 2003 and 2010 lightcurves have the same rotation
period and appear in phase when shifted by an integer number of full rotations,
also consistent with high obliquity. Based on the new 2010 lightcurve data, we
find that 2001 QG298 has an obliquity {\epsilon}=90\pm30 deg. Current estimates
of the intrinsic fraction of contact binaries in the Kuiper belt are debiased
assuming that these objects have randomly oriented spins. If, as 2001 QG298,
KBO contact binaries tend to have large obliquities, a larger correction is
required. As a result, the abundance of contact binaries may be larger than

XMM-Newton in March 2007, 20 months after the optical outburst. The X-ray
spectrum showed that the nova had evolved to a pure supersoft X-ray source,
indicative of residual H-burning on top of the white dwarf. The X-ray
light-curve shows abrupt decreases and increases of the flux by a factor 8 with
a periodicity of 2.97h, consistent with the possible orbital period of the
system. The EPIC spectra are well fit with an ONe white dwarf atmosphere model,
with the same temperature both in the low and the high flux periods. This rules
out an intrinsic variation of the X-ray source as the origin of the flux
changes, and points to a possible partial eclipse as the origin of the variable
light curve. The RGS high resolution spectra support this scenario showing a
number of emission features in the low flux state, which either disappear or
change into absorption features in the high flux state. A new XMM-Newton
observation in March 2009 shows the SSS had turned off and V5116 Sgr had
evolved into a weaker and harder X-ray source.","[{'name': 'Gloria Sala', 'affiliation': 'UPC-IEEC'}, {'name': 'Margarita Hernanz', 'affiliation': 'CSIC-IEEC'}, {'name': 'Carlo Ferri', 'affiliation': 'CSIC-IEEC'}, {'name': 'Jochen Greiner', 'affiliation': 'MPE'}]","4 pages, to appear in Astronomische Nachrichten",http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4471v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asna.200911327', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.4471v1']",astro-ph.HE,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.SR']",10.1002/asna.200911327,

in the Kes 73 supernova remnant obtained with the Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array (NuSTAR). Combined with new Swift and archival XMM-Newton and
Chandra observations, the phase-averaged spectrum is well characterized by a
blackbody plus double power-law model, in agreement with previous,
multi-mission X-ray results. However, we are unable to reproduce the spectral
results reported using Suzaku observations. The pulsed fraction of the source
is found to increase with photon energy. The measured rms pulsed fraction is
~12% and ~17% at ~20 keV and ~50 keV, respectively. We detect a new feature in
the 24--35 keV band pulse profile that is uniquely double-peaked. This feature
may be associated with a possible absorption or emission feature in the
phase-resolved spectrum. We fit the X-ray data using the recently developed
electron-positron outflow model of Beloborodov (2013) for the hard X-ray
emission from magnetars. This produces a satisfactory fit allowing a constraint
on the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes of the neutron star of ~20
degrees and on the angle between the rotation axis and line-of-sight of ~50
degrees. In this model, the soft X-ray component is inconsistent with a single
blackbody; adding a second blackbody or a power-law component fits the data.

the Sun. Yet, knowledge of its magnetic fields and meridional circulation is
confined much closer to the surface, and latitudinal entropy gradients are
below detectable limits. While numerical simulations can offer insight into the
interior dynamics and help identify which ingredients are necessary to
reproduce particular observations, some features of the Sun can be understood
analytically from an equilibrium perspective. Examples of such features
include: the 1D density profile arising from steady-state energy transport from
the core to the surface, and the tilting of isorotation contours in the
convection zone (CZ) due to baroclinic forcing. To help identify which features
can be explained by equilibrium, we propose analyzing stationary axisymmetric
ideal magnetohydrodynamic flows in the solar regime. By prescribing an
appropriate entropy profile at the surface, we recover a rotation profile that
reasonably matches observations in the bulk of the CZ. Additionally, by
including the effects of poloidal flow, we reproduce a feature that is
reminiscent of the near surface shear layer. However, no tachocline-like
feature is seen in hydrodynamic equilibrium, suggesting the importance of
either dynamics or magnetic fields in its description.","[{'name': 'Lee Gunderson'}, {'name': 'Amitava Bhattacharjee'}]",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08069v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08069v3,astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],,

main-sequence F star (V=11.8 mag) and a giant planet, WASP-174b (orbital period
4.23 days). However only an upper limit was placed on the planet mass (<1.3
Mj), and a highly uncertain planetary radius (0.7-1.7 Rj) was determined. We
aim to better characterise both the star and the planet and precisely measure
their orbital and physical parameters. In order to constrain the mass of the
planet, we obtained new measurements of the radial velocity of the star and
joined them with those from the discovery paper. Photometric data from the
HATSouth survey and new multi-band, high-quality (precision reached up to
0.37~mmag) photometric follow-up observations of transit events were acquired
and analysed for getting accurate photometric parameters. We fit the model to
all the observations, including data from the TESS space telescope, in two
different modes: incorporating the stellar isochrones into the fit, and using
an empirical method to get the stellar parameters. The two modes resulted to be
consistent with each other to within 2 sigma. We confirm the grazing nature of
the WASP-174b transits with a confidence level greater than 5 sigma, which is
also corroborated by simultaneously observing the transit through four optical
bands and noting how the transit depth changes due to the limb-darkening
effect. We estimate that ~76% of the disk of the planet actually eclipses the
parent star at mid-transit of its transit events. We find that WASP-174b is a
highly-inflated hot giant planet with a mass of 0.330 Mj and a radius of 1.435
Rj, and is therefore a good target for transmission-spectroscopy observations.

chromosphere and in the corona, above an enhanced network area at the boundary
of an equatorial coronal hole. A Fourier analysis is applied to a sequence of
images observed in the 171 A and 1600 A passbands of TRACE. Four interesting
features above the magnetic network are further investigated by using a wavelet
analysis. Our results reveal that, in both the 171 A and 1600 A passbands,
oscillations above the magnetic network show a lack of power at high
frequencies (5.0-8.3 mHz), and a significant power at low (1.3-2.0 mHz) and
intermediate frequencies (2.6-4.0 mHz). The global 5-min oscillation is clearly
present in the 4 analyzed features when seen in the 1600 A passband, and is
also found with enhanced power in feature 1 (leg of a large coronal loop) and
feature 2 (legs of a coronal bright point loop) when seen in the 171 A
passband. Two features above an enhanced network element (feature 3 and feature
4) show repeated propagating behaviors with a dominant period of 10 min and 5
min, respectively. We suggest these oscillations are likely to be slow
magneto-acoustic waves propagating along inclined magnetic field lines, from
the lower solar atmosphere into the corona. The energy flux carried by these
waves is estimated of the order of 40 erg cm\^{-2} s\^{-1} for the 171 A
passband and is far lower than the energy required to heat the quiet corona.
For the 1600 A passband, the energy flux is about 1.4*10^6 erg cm\^{-2}
s\^{-1}, which is about one third of the required energy budget for the
chromosphere.","[{'name': 'H. Tian'}, {'name': 'L. -D. Xia'}]","7 pages, 8 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0818v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:200810124', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.0818v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.1051/0004-6361:200810124,"Astron.Astrophys.488:331-333,2008"

Puppis obtained simultaneously in three filters (u', HeII $\lambda$4686, r')
with the ULTRACAM camera mounted at the ESO-VLT telescope. An analysis of a
long 50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the source, retrieved from the database,
is also provided. Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are clearly detected in
the optical during the source bright phase intervals when the accreting pole is
visible, confirming the association of the QPOs with the basis of the accretion
column. QPOs are detected in the three filters at a mean frequency of $\sim$
0.7 Hz with a similar amplitude $\sim$ 1\%. Mean orbitally-averaged power
spectra during the bright phase show a rather broad excess with a quality
factor Q= $\nu$/$\Delta \nu$ = 5-7 but smaller data segments commonly show a
much higher coherency with Q up to 30. The XMM (0.5--10 keV) observation
provides the first accurate estimation of the hard X-ray component with a high
kT $\sim$ 40 keV temperature and confirms the high EUV-soft/hard ratio in the
range of (4--15) for VV Pup. The detailed X-ray orbital light curve displays a
short $\Delta \phi \simeq 0.05$ ingress into self-eclipse of the active pole,
indicative of a accretion shock height of $\sim$ 75 km. No significant X-ray
QPOs are detected with an amplitude upper limit of $\sim$30\% in the range
(0.1--5) Hz. Detailed hydrodynamical numerical simulations of the post-shock
accretion region with parameters consistent with VV Pup demonstrate that the
expected frequencies from radiative instability are identical for X-rays and
optical regime at values $\nu$ $\sim$ (40--70) Hz, more than one order
magnitude higher than observed. This confirms previous statements suggesting
that present instability models are unable to explain the full QPO
characteristics within the parameters commonly known for polars.","[{'name': 'J. M. Bonnet-Bidaud'}, {'name': 'M. Mouchet'}, {'name': 'E. Falize'}, {'name': 'L. Van Box Som'}, {'name': 'C.

the common understanding of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The same
population of ultra-relativistic electrons is often thought to be responsible
for both X-ray and VHE emission. We thus systematically searched for X-ray
flares at sub-hour timescales of TeV blazars in the entire Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer archival database. We found rapid flares from PKS 2005-489 and S5
0716+714, and a candidate rapid flare from 1ES 1101-232. In particular, the
characteristic rise timescale of PKS 2005-489 is less than half a minute,
which, to our knowledge, is the shortest among known AGN flares at any
wavelengths. The timescales of these rapid flares indicate that the size of the
central supermassive black hole is not a hard lower limit on the physical size
of the emission region of the flare. PKS 2005-489 shows possible hard lags in
its flare, which could be attributed to particle acceleration (injection), its
flaring component has the hardest spectrum when it first appears. For all
flares, the flaring components show similar hard spectra with $\Gamma=1.7-1.9$,
and we estimate the magnetic field strength $B\sim$ 0.1--1.0 G by assuming
synchrotron cooling. These flares could be caused by inhomogeneity of the jets.

penetrates equally into every media because it cannot be shielded. The extra
terrestrial fgravity is responsible for earth's trajectory. However its
correlation or geodesic deviation is manifested as semi-diurnal and diurnal
tides. Tidal signals, A(t) are temporal modulations in the field differential
which can be observed in a wide variety of natural and laboratory situations.
A(t) is a quasi-static, low frequency signal which arises from the relative
changes in positions of the detector and source and is not part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to recognize the
importance of tides in astrometry and attempetd to estimate lunar mass from
ocean tides. By a case study we show, how the systematics of the gravitational
correlation can be used for calibration and de-trending which can significantly
increase the confidence level of high precision experiments. A(t) can also be
used to determine the distribution of celestial masses independently of the
""1-2-3"" law. Guided by modern advances in gravity wave detectors we argue that
it is important to develop high precision accelerometry. With a resolution of
about a nano-m it will be possible to determine solar system masses and detect
the SMBH at the center of our galaxy. Observations of the gravitational
correlation can potentially open up yet to be explored vistas of the cosmos.","[{'name': 'Timir Datta'}, {'name': 'Ming Yin'}, {'name': 'Mike Wescott'}, {'name': 'Yeuncheol Jeong'}, {'name': 'Pawel Morawiec'}, {'name': 'James Gambrell'}, {'name': 'Dan Overcash'}, {'name': 'Huaizhou Zhang'}, {'name': 'George Voulgaris'}]","28 pages, 3 tables and 10 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.3043v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.3043v1,astro-ph.IM,['astro-ph.IM'],,

bright for almost two years with little spectral evolution, is still unclear.
We here propose that iPTF14hls was not a sudden outburst like supernovae but
rather a long-term outflow similar to stellar winds. The properties of
iPTF14hls, which are at odds with a supernova scenario, become natural when
interpreted as a stellar wind with variable mass-loss rate. Based on the wind
hypothesis, we estimate the mass-loss rates of iPTF14hls in the bright phase.
We find that the instantaneous mass-loss rate of iPTF14hls during the 2-year
bright phase was more than a few Msun/yr (""hyper-wind"") and it reached as much
as 10 Msun/yr. The total mass lost over two years was about 10 Msun.
Interestingly, we find that the light curve of iPTF14hls has a very similar
shape to that of eta Carinae during the Great Eruption, which also experienced
a similar but less extreme brightening accompanied by extraordinary mass loss,
shedding more than 10 Msun in 10 years. The progenitor of iPTF14hls is less
than 150 Msun if it still exists, which is similar to eta Carinae. The two
phenomena may be related to a continuum-driven extreme wind from very massive

and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that emit intense light believed
to come from an accretion disk near a super-massive black hole (Rees 1984,
Lynden-Bell 1969). To understand the zoo of different AGN classes, it has been
suggested that all AGN are the same type of object viewed from different angles
(Antonucci 1993). This model -- called AGN unification -- has been successful
in predicting e.g. the existence of hidden broad optical lines in the spectrum
of many narrow-line AGN. But this model is not unchallenged (Tran 2001) and it
is an open problem whether more than viewing angle separates the so-called
Type-1 and Type-2 AGN. Here we report the first large-scale study that finds
strong differences in the galaxy neighbours to Type-1 and Type-2 AGN with data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) Data Release 7
(DR7) (Abazajian et al. 2008) and Galaxy Zoo (Lintott et al, 2008, Lintott et
al 2011). We find strong differences in the colour and AGN activity of the
neighbours to Type-1 and Type-2 AGN and in how the fraction of AGN residing in
spiral hosts changes depending on the presence of a neighbour or not. These
findings suggest that an evolutionary link between the two major AGN types
might exist.","[{'name': 'Beatriz Villarroel'}, {'name': 'Andreas J. Korn'}]","Published in Nature Physics 10, 417-420 (2014); includes all

  Implications for Globular Cluster Formation and Galaxy Assembly","We confirm that the number of globular clusters (GCs), N$_{GC}$, is an
excellent tracer of their host galaxy's halo virial mass M$_{vir}$. The simple
linear relation M$_{vir} = 5 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot} \times$ N$_{GC}$ fits the
data perfectly from M$_{vir} = 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ to M$_{vir} = 2 \times
10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$. This result is independent of galaxy morphology and
extends statistically into the dwarf galaxy regime with M$_{vir} = 10^8 -
10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, including the extreme ultra diffuse galaxy DF44. As this
correlation does not depend on GC mass it is ideally suited for high-precision
determinations of M$_{vir}$. The linearity is most simply explained by
cosmological merging of a high-redshift halo seed population that hosted on
average one GC per $5 \times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ of dark matter. We show that
hierarchical merging is also extremely powerful in restoring a linear
correlation and erasing signatures of even a strong secular evolution of GC
systems. The cosmological merging scenario also implies a strong decline of the
scatter in $N_{GC}$ with increasing virial mass $\delta N_{GC}/N_{GC} \sim
M_{vir}^{-1/2}$ in contrast with the observations that show a roughly constant
scatter, independent of virial mass. This discrepancy can be explained if
errors in determining virial masses from kinematical tracers and gravitational
lensing are on the order of a factor of 2. GCs in dwarf satellite galaxies pose
a serious problem for high-redshift GC formation scenarios; the dark halo
masses of dwarf galaxies hosting GCs therefore might need to be an order of
magnitude larger than currently estimated.","[{'name': 'Andreas Burkert'}, {'name': 'Duncan Forbes'}]","11 pages, 4 figures, ApJ in press",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00900v3,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab5b0e', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00900v3']",astro-ph.GA,['astro-ph.GA'],10.3847/1538-3881/ab5b0e,

produced an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical

extinction) to give insight into the physical properties of Milky-Way stars.
Exploiting the power of multi-wavelength and multi-survey observations from
Gaia DR2 parallaxes and integrated photometry along with 2MASS and AllWISE
photometry, we introduce an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar
astrophysical parameters, including dust extinction (A0) and average grain size
(R0) along the line of sight, for 123,097,070 stars. In contrast with previous
works, we do not use a Galactic model as prior in our analysis. We validate our
results against other literature (e.g., benchmark stars, interferometry,
Bayestar, StarHorse). The limited optical information in the Gaia photometric
bands or the lack of ultraviolet or spectroscopic information renders the
chemistry inference prior dominated. We demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes bring
sufficient leverage to explore the detailed structures of the interstellar
medium in our Milky Way. In Gaia DR3, we will obtain the dispersed optical
light information to break through some limitations of this analysis, allowing
us to infer stellar chemistry in particular. Gaia promises us data to construct
the most detailed view of the chemo-dynamics of field star populations in our

  by VIRGO","Context. The variability of Solar Spectral Irradiance over the rotational
period and its trend over the solar activity cycle are important for
understanding the Sun-Earth connection as well as for observational constraints
for solar models. Recently the SIM experiment on SORCE has published an
unexpected negative correlation with Total Solar Irradiance of the visible
spectral range. It is compensated by a strong and positive variability of the
near UV range. Aims. We aim to verify whether the anti-correlated
SIM/SORCE-trend in the visible can be confirmed by independent observations of
the VIRGO experiment on SOHO. The challenge of all space experiments measuring
solar irradiance are sensitivity changes of their sensors due to exposure to
intense UV radiation, which are difficult to assess in orbit. Methods. We
analyze a 10-year time series of VIRGO sun photometer data between 2002 and
2012. The variability of Spectral Solar Irradiance is correlated with the
variability of the Total Solar Irradiance, which is taken as a proxy for solar
activity. Results. Observational evidence indicates that after six years only
one single long-term process governs the degradation of the backup sun
photometer in VIRGO which is operated once in a month. This degradation can be
well approximated by a linear function over ten years. The analysis of the
residuals from the linear trend yield robust positive correlations of spectral
irradiance at 862, 500 and 402 nm with total irradiance. In the analysis of
annual averages of these data the positive correlations change into weak
negative correlations, but of little statistical significance, for the 862 nm
and 402 nm data. At 500 nm the annual spectral data are still positively
correlated with Total Solar Irradiance. The persisting positive correlation at
500 nm is in contradiction to the SIM/SORCE results.","[{'name': 'C. Wehrli'}, {'name': 'W. Schmutz'}, {'name': 'A. I.

such as circularization, perform poorly. However, mission designers have
noticed a particular characteristic of low lunar orbits, which they have found
useful for stationkeeping and dubbed the ""translation theorem"", wherein the
eccentricity vector follows a predictable monthly pattern that is independent
of its starting value. We demonstrate this feature results from the low orbital
eccentricity combined with the dominant effect of a particular subset of
sectoral and tesseral harmonics. Subsequently, automated stationkeeping
strategies for eLLOs are presented, utilizing this theorem for eccentricity
vector control. Several constraints within the eccentricity vector plane are
explored, including circular, annular, and elevation-model derived regions,
each forming distinct stationkeeping strategies for varying orbital
configurations. Subsequently, the optimal control profiles for these maneuvers
within the eccentricity plane are obtained using Sequential Convex Programming
(SCP). The proposed strategies offer computational simplicity and clear
advantages when compared to traditional methods and are comparable to full
trajectory optimization.","[{'name': 'Jack Yarndley'}, {'name': 'Martin Lara'}, {'name': 'Harry Holt'}, {'name': 'Roberto Armellin'}]","30 pages, 15 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19559v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19559v1,astro-ph.IM,"['astro-ph.IM', 'astro-ph.EP']",,

  1-1.5: evolution in the size and luminosity of giant HII regions","We present HST/WFC3 narrowband imaging of the H-alpha emission in a sample of
eight gravitationally-lensed galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5. The magnification caused
by the foreground clusters enables us to obtain a median source plane spatial
resolution of 360pc, as well as providing magnifications in flux ranging from
~10x to ~50x. This enables us to identify resolved star-forming HII regions at
this epoch and therefore study their H-alpha luminosity distributions for
comparisons with equivalent samples at z ~ 2 and in the local Universe. We find
evolution in the both luminosity and surface brightness of HII regions with
redshift. The distribution of clump properties can be quantified with an HII
region luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with an exponential
break at some cut-off, and we find that the cut-off evolves with redshift. We
therefore conclude that `clumpy' galaxies are seen at high redshift because of
the evolution of the cut-off mass; the galaxies themselves follow similar
scaling relations to those at z = 0, but their HII regions are larger and
brighter and thus appear as clumps which dominate the morphology of the galaxy.
A simple theoretical argument based on gas collapsing on scales of the Jeans
mass in a marginally unstable disk shows that the clumpy morphologies of high-z
galaxies are driven by the competing effects of higher gas fractions causing
perturbations on larger scales, partially compensated by higher epicyclic
frequencies which stabilise the disk.","[{'name': 'R. C. Livermore', 'affiliation': '- ICC, Durham University'}, {'name': 'T. Jones', 'affiliation': '- Caltech'}, {'name': 'J.

behavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple,
collocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae
going off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.
This strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer
shock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with
no further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,
10s of pc), and stall at scales $\lesssim 100$ pc. We show that isolated
supernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by a Myr, but
superbubbles can retain up to $\sim 40\%$ of the input energy in form of
mechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster (few 10s of Myr). These
conclusions hold even in the presence of realistic magnetic fields and thermal
conduction. We also compare various recipes for implementing supernova feedback
in numerical simulations. For various feedback prescriptions we derive the
spatial scale below which the energy needs to be deposited for it to couple to
the interstellar medium (ISM). We show that a steady thermal wind within the
superbubble appears only for a large number ($\gtrsim 10^4$) of supernovae. For
smaller clusters we expect multiple internal shocks instead of a smooth, dense

explanations for the non-thermal emission include cosmic-ray injection from the
Galactic center by high speed Galactic winds/jets, acceleration by multiple
shocks or plasma turbulence present inside the bubbles, and acceleration by
strong shock waves associated with the expansion of the bubbles. In this paper,
I will discuss the possibility that the gamma-ray emission is produced by the
injection of Galactic cosmic-rays mainly protons during their diffusive
propagation through the Galaxy. The protons interact with the bubble plasma

  Mechanisms and Implications for the Origin of WNL Stars","The evolutionary paths taken by massive stars with $M \gtrsim 60 \,
\mathrm{M}_\odot$ remain substantially uncertain. They begin their lives as
main sequence (MS) O-stars. Depending on their masses, rotation rates, and
metallicities, they can then encounter a wide range of evolutionary states with
an equally broad set of possible surface compositions and spectral
classifications. We present a new grid of calculations for the evolution of
such stars that covers a broad range in mass, M/M$_\odot = 60$ to $150$,
rotation rate, $v \, / \, v_{\rm crit} = 0$ to $0.6$, metallicity,
$[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}] = -4$ to $0$, and $\alpha$-element enhancement,
$[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}] = 0$ to $0.4$. We show that rotating stars undergo
rotationally-induced dredge-up of nucleosynthetic products, mostly He and N, to
their surfaces while still on the MS. Non-rotating metal-rich stars also reveal
the products of nucleosynthesis on their surfaces because even modest amounts
of mass loss expose their ""fossil"" convective cores: regions that are no longer
convective, but which were part of the convective core at an early stage in the
star's evolution. Thus surface enhancement of He and N is expected for rotating
stars at all metallicities, and for non-rotating stars if they are relatively
metal-rich. We calculate a stellar atmosphere for a representative model from
our grid, properly accounting for He- and N-enhancement, and show that the
resulting spectrum provides a good match to observed WNL stars, strongly
suggesting that the physical mechanisms we have identified are the ultimate
cause of the WNL phase.","[{'name': 'Arpita Roy'}, {'name': 'Ralph S Sutherland'}, {'name': 'Mark R Krumholz'}, {'name': 'Alexander Heger'}, {'name': 'Michael A Dopita'}]","21 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS, in

distances in many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We use 3D relativistic MHD
(RMHD) simulations to study the propagation of Poynting flux-driven jets in
AGN. These jets are assumed already being launched from the vicinity ($\sim
10^3$ gravitational radii) of supermassive black holes. Jet injections are
characterized by a model described in Li et al. (2006) and we follow the
propagation of these jets to ~ parsec scales. We find that these
current-carrying jets are always collimated and mildly relativistic. When
$\alpha$, the ratio of toroidal-to-poloidal magnetic flux injection, is large
the jet is subject to non-axisymmetric current-driven instabilities (CDI) which
lead to substantial dissipation and reduced jet speed. However, even with the
presence of instabilities, the jet is not disrupted and will continue to
propagate to large distances. We suggest that the relatively weak impact by the
instability is due to the nature of the instability being convective and the
fact that the jet magnetic fields are rapidly evolving on Alfv\'enic timescale.
We present the detailed jet properties and show that far from the jet launching
region, a substantial amount of magnetic energy has been transformed into
kinetic energy and thermal energy, producing a jet magnetization number $\sigma
< 1$. In addition, we have also studied the effects of a gas pressure supported
""disk"" surrounding the injection region and qualitatively similar global jet
behaviors were observed. We stress that jet collimation, CDIs, and the
subsequent energy transitions are intrinsic features of current-carrying jets.","[{'name': 'Xiaoyue Guan'}, {'name': 'Hui Li'}, {'name': 'Shengtai Li'}]","49 pages, 22 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0661v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/781/1/48', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0661v1']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.1088/0004-637X/781/1/48,

  $\rm 80~$kpc from the SEGUE K-giant Survey","We characterise the radial density, metallicity and flattening profile of the
Milky Way's stellar halo, based on the large sample of 1757 spectroscopically
confirmed giant stars from SDSS/SEGUE-2 after excising stars that were
algorithmically attributed to apparent halo substructure (including the
Sagittarius stream). Compared to BHB stars or RR Lyrae, giants are more readily
understood tracers of the overall halo star population, with less bias in age
or metallicity. The well-characterized selection function of the sample enables
forward modelling of those data, based on ellipsoidal stellar density models,
$\nu_* (R,z)$, with Einasto profiles and (broken) power laws for their radial
dependence, combined with a model for the metallicity gradient and the
flattening profile. Among models with constant flattening, these data are
reasonably well fit by an Einasto profile of $n=3.1\pm 0.5$ with an effective
radius $\rm r_{eff} = 15\pm2~$kpc and a flattening of $q=0.7\pm 0.02$; or
comparably well by an equally flattened broken power-law, with radial slopes of
$\alpha_{in}=2.1\pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{out}=3.8\pm 0.1$, with a break-radius of
$r_{break}=18\pm1$~kpc; this is largely consistent with earlier work. We find a
modest, but significant metallicity gradient within the ""outer"" stellar halo,
$\rm [Fe/H]$ decreasing outward. If we allow for a variable flattening $q =
f(r_{GC} )$, we find the distribution of halo giants to be considerably more
flattened at small radii, $q({\rm 10~kpc})\sim 0.57$, compared to $q(>30{\rm
kpc})\sim 0.8$. Remarkably, the data are then very well fit by a single
power-law of index $\rm \sim 4.2\pm0.1$ of the variable
$r_q\equiv\sqrt{R^2+(z/q(r))^2}$. In this simple and better fitting model,
there is a break in flattening at $\sim 20$~kpc, instead of a break in the

  observations","Several tens of massive binary systems display indirect, or even strong
evidence for non-thermal radio emission, hence their particle accelerator
status. These objects are referred to as particle-accelerating colliding-wind
binaries (PACWBs). WR 133 is one of the shortest period Wolf-Rayet + O systems
in this category, and is therefore critical to characterize the boundaries of
the parameter space adequate for particle acceleration in massive binaries. Our
methodology consists in analyzing JVLA observations of WR 133 at different
epochs to search for compelling evidence for a phase-locked variation
attributable to synchrotron emission produced in the colliding-wind region. New
data obtained during two orbits reveal a steady and thermal emission spectrum,
in apparent contradiction with the previous detection of non-thermal emission.
The thermal nature of the radio spectrum along the 112.4-d orbit is supported
by the strong free-free absorption by the dense stellar winds, and shows that
the simple binary scenario cannot explain the non-thermal emission reported
previously. Alternatively, a triple system scenario with a wide, outer orbit
would fit with the observational facts reported previously and in this paper,
albeit no hint for the existence of a third component exists to date. The
epoch-dependent nature of the identification of synchrotron radio emission in
WR 133 emphasizes the issue of observational biases in the identification of
PACWBs, that undoubtedly affect the present census of PACWB among
colliding-wind binaries.","[{'name': 'M. De Becker'}, {'name': 'N. L. Isequilla'}, {'name': 'P.

solar-mass primary in a 5"" visual binary (also TIC 284730577), by the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. This dimming, as has been shown for
other ""dipper"" stars, is likely due to occultation by circumstellar dust. The
barycentric space motion, lithium abundance, rotation, and chromospheric
emission of the stars in this system point to an age of ~125 Myr, and possible
membership in the AB Doradus moving group. As such it occupies an important but

is produced by collisions of planetesimals during clearing of a residual disk
at the end of rocky planet formation, and that quasi-periodic dimming is
produced by the rapid disintegration of a 100 km planetesimal near the silicate

  but not versus total stellar mass over the last 9 Gyrs?","We constrain the ratio of black hole (BH) mass to total stellar mass of
type-1 AGN in the COSMOS survey at 1<z<2. For 10 AGN at mean redshift z~1.4
with both HST/ACS and HST/NICMOS imaging data we are able to compute total
stellar mass M_(*,total), based on restframe UV-to-optical host galaxy colors
which constrain mass-to-light ratios. All objects have virial BH mass-estimates
available from the COSMOS Magellan/IMACS and zCOSMOS surveys. We find zero
difference between the M_BH--M_(*,total)-relation at z~1.4 and the
M_BH--M_(*,bulge)-relation in the local Universe.
  Our interpretation is: (a) If our objects were purely bulge-dominated, the
M_BH--M_(*,bulge)-relation has not evolved since z~1.4. However, (b) since we
have evidence for substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies
(logM_(*,total)=11.1+-0.25 or logM_BH~8.3+-0.2) must have grown over the last 9
Gyrs predominantly by redistribution of disk- into bulge-mass. Since all
necessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation or
addition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.
induced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. Merging, in
addition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both BH and
stellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final M_BH/M_(*,bulge)
ratio.
  Since the overall cosmic stellar and BH mass buildup trace each other tightly
over time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independent
of any strong BH-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling BH and bulge
mass until the present is very indirect.","[{'name': 'Knud Jahnke'}, {'name': 'Angela Bongiorno'}, {'name': 'Marcella Brusa'}, {'name': 'Peter Capak'}, {'name': 'Nico Cappelluti'}, {'name': 'Mauricio Cisternas'}, {'name': 'Francesca Civano'}, {'name': 'James Colbert'}, {'name': 'Andrea Comastri'}, {'name': 'Martin Elvis'}, {'name': 'Günther Hasinger'}, {'name': 'Chris Impey'}, {'name': 'Katherine Inskip'}, {'name': 'Anton M.

rotation of the Sun. One of the important achievements was the discovery of two
radial shear layers: one near the bottom of the convection zone (the
tachocline) and one near the surface. These shear layers may be important
ingredients for explaining the magnetic cycle of the Sun. We measure the
logarithmic radial gradient of the rotation rate ($\rm d\ln\Omega/\rm d\ln r$)
near the surface of the Sun using 15 years of f mode rotational frequency
splittings from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and four years of data from
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). We model the angular velocity of
the Sun in the upper $\sim 10$ Mm as changing linearly with depth and use a
multiplicative optimally localized averaging inversion to infer the gradient of
the rotation rate as a function of latitude. Both the MDI and HMI data show
that $\rm d\ln\Omega/\rm d\ln r$ is close to $-1$ from the equator to
60$^{\circ}$ latitude and stays negative up to 75$^{\circ}$ latitude. However,
the value of the gradient is different for MDI and HMI for latitudes above
$60^{\circ}$. Additionally, there is a significant difference between the value
of $d\ln\Omega/d\ln r$ using an older and recently reprocessed MDI data for
latitudes above $30^\circ$. We could reliably infer the value of $\rm
d\ln\Omega/\rm d\ln r$ up to 60$^{\circ}$, but not above this latitude, which
will hopefully constrain theories of the near-surface shear layer and dynamo.
Furthermore, the recently reprocessed MDI splitting data are more reliable than

modes.","[{'name': 'Atefeh Barekat'}, {'name': 'Jesper Schou'}, {'name': 'Laurent Gizon'}]","4 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A Letters",http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3162v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424839', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3162v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.1051/0004-6361/201424839,

  heavy bombardment","In the Nice model, the late heavy bombardment (LHB) is related to an orbital
instability of giant planets which causes a fast dynamical dispersion of a
transneptunian cometary disk. We study effects produced by these hypothetical
cometary projectiles on main-belt asteroids. In particular, we want to check
whether the observed collisional families provide a lower or an upper limit for
the cometary flux during the LHB.
  We present an updated list of observed asteroid families as identified in the
space of synthetic proper elements by the hierarchical clustering method,
colour data, albedo data and dynamical considerations and we estimate their
physical parameters. We selected 12 families which may be related to the LHB
according to their dynamical ages. We then used collisional models and N-body
orbital simulations to gain insight into the long-term dynamical evolution of
synthetic LHB families over 4 Gyr. We account for the mutual collisions, the
physical disruptions of comets, the Yarkovsky/YORP drift, chaotic diffusion, or
possible perturbations by the giant-planet migration.
  Assuming a ""standard"" size-frequency distribution of primordial comets, we
predict the number of families with parent-body sizes D_PB >= 200 km which
seems consistent with observations. However, more than 100 asteroid families
with D_PB >= 100 km should be created at the same time which are not observed.
This discrepancy can be nevertheless explained by the following processes: i)
asteroid families are efficiently destroyed by comminution (via collisional
cascade), ii) disruptions of comets below some critical perihelion distance (q
<~ 1.5 AU) are common.
  Given the freedom in the cometary-disruption law, we cannot provide stringent
limits on the cometary flux, but we can conclude that the observed distribution
of asteroid families does not contradict with a cometary LHB.","[{'name': 'M. Brož'}, {'name': 'A. Morbidelli'}, {'name': 'W. F. Bottke'}, {'name': 'J. Rozehnal'}, {'name': 'D.

II, and its effective temperature is Teff ~5400 K. An unusual spectral
phenomenon was discovered: splitting of the profiles of broad, stationary
absorption lines of medium and low intensity. The heliocentric radial
velocities Vr of all components of metal absorption lines, the NaI D lines, and
the H$\alpha$ line were measured for all the observation epochs. The constancy
of the absorption lines rules out the possibility that the line splitting is
due to binarity. The radial velocities of the wind components in the profiles
of the NaI D and H$\alpha$ lines reach $-250$ and $-600$ km/s, respectively.
These profiles have narrow components, whose number, depth, and position vary
with time. The time variability and multicomponent structure of the profiles of

relativity (GR), or modified gravity. It is of interest to differentiate
between them, by using both the expansion history and the growth history. In
the literature, it was proposed that the growth index $\gamma$ is useful to
distinguish these two scenarios. In this work, we consider the non-parametric
reconstruction of the growth index $\gamma$ as a function of redshift $z$ from
the latest observational data as of July 2018 via Gaussian Processes. We find
that $f(R)$ theories and dark energy models within GR (especially $\Lambda$CDM)
are inconsistent with the results in the moderate redshift range far beyond
$3\sigma$ confidence level. A modified gravity scenario different from $f(R)$
theories is favored. However, these results can also be due to other
non-trivial possibilities, in which dark energy models within GR (especially
$\Lambda$CDM) and $f(R)$ theories might still survive. In all cases, our
results suggest that new physics is required.","[{'name': 'Zhao-Yu Yin'}, {'name': 'Hao Wei'}]","12 pages, 9 figures, revtex4; v2: discussions added, SCPMA in press;

polarisation degree), 4.7 deg. (polarisation angle), and 0.23% (circular
polarisation), while the corresponding values at 1.3mm are 1.7%, 9.9 deg., and

our calibrators Mars and Uranus. For the quasar 3C286, widely used as a linear

  ray astronomy","We present an analysis technique that uses the timing information of
Cherenkov images from extensive air showers (EAS). Our emphasis is on distant,
or large core distance gamma-ray induced showers at multi-TeV energies.
Specifically, combining pixel timing information with an improved direction
reconstruction algorithm, leads to improvements in angular and core resolution
as large as ~40% and ~30%, respectively, when compared with the same algorithm
without the use of timing. Above 10 TeV, this results in an angular resolution
approaching 0.05 degrees, together with a core resolution better than ~15 m.
The off-axis post-cut gamma-ray acceptance is energy dependent and its full
width at half maximum ranges from 4 degrees to 8 degrees. For shower directions
that are up to ~6 degrees off-axis, the angular resolution achieved by using
timing information is comparable, around 100 TeV, to the on-axis angular
resolution. The telescope specifications and layout we describe here are geared
towards energies above 10 TeV. However, the methods can in principle be applied
to other energies, given suitable telescope parameters. The 5-telescope cell
investigated in this study could initially pave the way for a larger array of
sparsely spaced telescopes in an effort to push the collection area to >10 km2.
These results highlight the potential of a `sparse array' approach in
effectively opening up the energy range above 10 TeV.","[{'name': 'V. Stamatescu'}, {'name': 'G. P. Rowell'}, {'name': 'J. Denman'}, {'name': 'R. W. Clay'}, {'name': 'B. R. Dawson'}, {'name': 'A. G.

  Objects","Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are small, icy bodies in the outer solar
system. They are observed to have a complex orbital distribution that was
shaped by the early dynamical history and migration of the giant planets.
Comparisons between the different dynamical classes of modeled and observed
TNOs can help constrain the history of the outer solar system. Because of the
complex dynamics of TNOs, particularly those in and near mean motion resonances
with Neptune, classification has traditionally been done by human inspection of
plots of the time evolution of orbital parameters. This is very inefficient.
The Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected
to increase the number of known TNOs by a factor of $\sim$10, necessitating a
much more automated process. In this chapter we present an improved supervised
machine learning classifier for TNOs. Using a large and diverse training set as
well as carefully chosen, dynamically motivated data features calculated from
numerical integrations of TNO orbits, our classifier returns results that match
those of a human classifier 98% of the time, and dynamically relevant
classifications 99.7% of the time. This classifier is dramatically more
efficient than human classification, and it will improve classification of both

based on an axisymmetric mean field dynamo model and magnetic surface data, our
mid-term goal is to predict the solar quasi cyclic activity. Here we focus on
the ability of our algorithm to constrain the deep meridional circulation of
the Sun based on solar magnetic observations. To that end, we develop a
variational data assimilation technique. Within a given assimilation window,
the assimilation procedure minimizes the differences between data and the
forecast from the model, by finding an optimal meridional circulation in the
convection zone, and an optimal initial magnetic field, via a quasi-Newton
algorithm. We demonstrate the capability of the technique to estimate the
meridional flow by a closed-loop experiment involving 40 years of synthetic,
solar-like data. By assimilating the synthetic magnetic proxies annually, we
are able to reconstruct a (stochastic) time-varying meridional circulation
which is also slightly equatorially asymmetric. We show that the method is
robust in estimating a flow whose level of fluctuation can reach 30% about the
average, and that the horizon of predictive capability of the method is of the
order of 1 cycle length.","[{'name': 'Ching Pui Hung'}, {'name': 'Allan Sacha Brun'}, {'name': 'Alexandre Fournier'}, {'name': 'Laurène Jouve'}, {'name': 'Olivier Talagrand'}, {'name': 'Mustapha Zakari'}]","Accepted for publication in ApJ. 23 figures, 20 pages. 1 Institut de

UHECRs above 50~EeV when compared with the Auger spectrum. We consider the
possibility that both the TA excess and hotspot are due to a dominant source in
the Northern sky. We carry out detailed simulations of UHECR propagation in
both the intergalactic medium and the Galaxy, using different values for the
intergalactic magnetic field. We consider two general classes of sources:
transients and steady, adopting a mixed UHECR composition that is consistent
with the one found by Auger. The spatial location of the sources is draw
randomly. We generate Auger-like and TA-like data sets from which we determine
the spectrum, the sky maps and the level of anisotropy. We find that, while
steady sources are favored over transients, it is unlikely to account for all
the currently available observational data. While we reproduce fairly well the
Auger spectrum for the vast majority of the simulated data sets, most of the
simulated data sets with a spectrum compatible with that of TA (at most a few
percent depending on density model tested) show a much stronger anisotropy than
the one observed. We find that the rare cases in which both the spectrum and
the anisotropy are consistent require a steady source within $\sim 10$ Mpc, to
account for the flux excess, and a strong extragalactic magnetic field $\sim
10$ nG, to reduce the excessive anisotropy.","[{'name': 'Noemie Globus'}, {'name': 'Denis Allard'}, {'name': 'Etienne Parizot'}, {'name': 'Cyril Lachaud'}, {'name': 'Tsvi Piran'}]","28 pages, 19 figures, accepted in ApJ",http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05319v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/836/2/163', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05319v2']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.3847/1538-4357/836/2/163,

with more insight into the formation of the aerosols in the upper atmospheric
layers. However, the chemical composition and mechanisms leading to their
formation were out of reach for the instruments onboard Cassini. In this
context, it is deemed necessary to apply and exploit laboratory simulations to
better understand the chemical reactivity occurring in the gas phase of
Titan-like conditions. In the present work, we report gas phase results
obtained from a plasma discharge simulating the chemical processes in Titan's
ionosphere. We use the PAMPRE cold dusty plasma experiment with an N2-CH4
gaseous mixture under controlled pressure and gas influx. An internal cryogenic
trap has been developed to accumulate the gas products during their production
and facilitate their detection. The cryogenic trap condenses the gas-phase
precursors while they are forming, so that aerosols are no longer observed

C2H2 and C2H4. The latter are identified and quantified by in situ mass
spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. We present here results from this

geometry and kinematics of the low-ionization and high-ionization broad line
region. The geometry is found to be a thick disk that is nearly face on,
inclined at $\sim 18^{\circ}$ to our line of sight, and exhibiting clear
ionization stratification, with an extended H$\beta$-emitting region ($r_{\rm

centrally-located He II-emitting region ($r_{\rm median}=1.33^{+0.34}_{-0.42}$

near-circular Keplerian orbits, but with $\sim 40$% of the orbits inflowing.
The more compact He II-emitting region, on the other hand, appears to be
dominated by outflowing orbits. The black hole mass is constrained to be
$M_{\rm BH}=2.82^{+1.55}_{-0.63}\times10^7$ $M_{\odot}$, which is consistent
with the simple reverberation constraint on the mass based on a mean time

  turbulent discs","The migration of low-mass planets is driven by the differential Lindblad
torque and the corotation torque in non-magnetic viscous models of
protoplanetary discs. The corotation torque has recently received detailed
attention as it may slow down, stall, or reverse migration. In laminar viscous
disc models, the long-term evolution of the corotation torque is intimately
related to viscous and thermal diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe
region. This paper examines the properties of the corotation torque in discs
where MHD turbulence develops as a result of the magnetorotational instability,
considering a weak initial toroidal magnetic field. We present results of 3D
MHD simulations carried out with two different codes. Non-ideal MHD effects and
the disc's vertical stratification are neglected, and locally isothermal disc
models are considered. The running time-averaged torque exerted by the disc on
a fixed planet is evaluated in three disc models. We first present results with
an inner disc cavity (planet trap). As in viscous disc models, the planet is
found to experience a positive running time-averaged torque over several
hundred orbits, which highlights the existence of an unsaturated corotation
torque maintained in the long term in MHD turbulent discs. Two disc models with
initial power-law density and temperature profiles are also adopted, in which
the time-averaged torque is found to be in decent agreement with its
counterpart in laminar viscous disc models with similar viscosity at the planet
location. Detailed analysis of the averaged torque density distributions
indicates that the differential Lindblad torque takes very similar values in
MHD turbulent and laminar viscous discs, and there exists an unsaturated
corotation torque in MHD turbulent discs. This analysis also reveals the
existence of an additional corotation torque in weakly magnetized discs.","[{'name': 'C. Baruteau'}, {'name': 'S. Fromang'}, {'name': 'R. P. Nelson'}, {'name': 'F. Masset'}]","16 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and

framework of PACS photometer characterization, irradiation tests were performed

radiation effects. The main objective was to study particles impacts on the
detectors applicable to future observations in orbit and possible hard and/or
soft curing to restore its performances. Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiations did
not show significant degradation, so we mainly focused on single events effects

tandem accelerator at the Institut de Physique Nucleaire (IPN, Orsay, France),
respectively at 20MeV and 30MeV. Observation showed that the shape of signal
perturbations clearly depends on the location of the impacts either on the
detector itself or the read-out circuit. Software curing has then to be
anticipated in order to deglitch the signal. This test gives also a unique
opportunity to measure some parameters of the detector: electrical crosstalk
and thermo- electrical time constant. However a detailed bolometer model is
necessary to understand the contribution of the thermal response in relation

  spectra at Very High Energies","For some blazars, the gamma-ray absorption features due to pair-production on
the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) are fainter than expected. The present
work reviews the main models that could explain this paradox, with emphasis on
conservative ones, that do not include any new physics. The models that are
intrinsic to the source, do allow a very hard primary spectrum, but fail to
explain a regular redshift dependence of the anomaly starting energy. The model
that includes a contribution from secondary photons produced by cosmic rays
(CR) near the Earth seems to require a well collimated CR beam, what is hard to
achieve. Finally, the model with secondary photons produced in electromagnetic
(EM) cascades initiated by primary gamma-rays is considered. In principle, it
allows to decrease the statistical significance of the anomaly and, while
requiring quite low EGMF strength B, does not contradict to most contemporary
constraints on the B value. Additionally, it is shown that the recently
observed correlation between directions to hard gamma-ray sources and voids in
the Large Scale Structure is a natural feature of the EM cascade model.",{'name': 'T. A. Dzhatdoev'},"8 pages, 4 figures. This paper tries to summarize the status of the

  Substructure Morphology in Planet-forming Discs","The traditional paradigm of viscosity-dominated evolution of protoplanetary
discs has been recently challenged by magnetized disc winds. However,
distinguishing wind-driven and turbulence-driven accretion through observations
has been difficult. In this study, we present a novel approach to identifying
their separate contribution to angular momentum transport by studying the gap
and ring morphology of planet-forming discs in the ALMA continuum. We model the
gap-opening process of planets in discs with both viscous evolution and
wind-driven accretion by 2D multi-fluid hydrodynamical simulations. Our results
show that gap-opening planets in wind-driven accreting discs generate
characteristic substructures that differ from those in purely viscous discs.
Specifically, we demonstrate that discs, where wind-driven accretion dominates
the production of substructures, exhibit significant asymmetries. Based on the
diverse outputs of mock images in the ALMA continuum, we roughly divide the
planet-induced features into four regimes (moderate-viscosity dominated,
moderate-wind dominated, strong-wind dominated, inviscid). The classification
of these regimes sets up a potential method to constrain the strength of
magnetized disc wind and viscosity based on the observed gap and ring
morphology. We discuss the asymmetry feature in our mock images and its
potential manifestation in ALMA observations.","[{'name': 'Yinhao Wu'}, {'name': 'Yi-Xian Chen'}, {'name': 'Haochang Jiang'}, {'name': 'Ruobing Dong'}, {'name': 'Enrique Macías'}, {'name': 'Min-Kai Lin'}, {'name': 'Giovanni P.

  Dynamical Models","We present a detailed dynamical analysis of the projected density and
kinematical data available for the globular cluster Omega Cen. We solve the
spherical anisotropic Jeans equation to predict the projected profiles of the
RMS velocity in each of the three orthogonal coordinate directions (line of
sight, proper motion radial, and proper motion tangential). We fit the models
to new HST star count and proper motion data near the cluster center presented
in Paper I, combined with existing ground-based measurements. We also derive
and model the Gauss-Hermite moments of the observed proper motion
distributions. The projected density profile is consistent with being flat near
the center, with an upper limit gamma=0.07 on the central logarithmic slope.
The RMS proper motion profile is also consistent with being flat near the
center, and there are no unusually fast-moving stars. The models provide a good
fit and yield a 1-sigma upper limit MBH < 1.2E4 solar masses on the mass of a
possible intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). The inferred upper limit
corresponds to MBH/Mtot < 0.43%. We combine this with results for other
clusters and discuss the implications for globular cluster IMBH demographics.
Tighter limits will be needed to rule out or establish whether globular
clusters follow the same black hole demographics correlations as galaxies. The
arguments put forward by Noyola et al. (2008) to suspect an IMBH in Omega Cen
are not confirmed by our study; the IMBH mass they suggested is firmly ruled
out.","[{'name': 'Roeland P. van der Marel'}, {'name': 'Jay Anderson'}]","28 pages, 11 figures, ApJ in press. v2 includes additions in response

massive magnetic early B-type stars. Dedicated XMM-Newton observations were
obtained for three stars xi1 CMa, V2052 Oph, and zeta Cas. We report the first
detection of X-ray emission from V2052 Oph and zeta Cas. The observations show
that the X-ray spectra of our program stars are quite soft. We compile the
complete sample of early B-type stars with detected magnetic fields to date and
existing X-ray measurements, in order to study whether the X-ray emission can
be used as a general proxy for stellar magnetism. We find that hard and strong
X-ray emission does not necessarily correlate with the presence of a magnetic
field. We analyze the UV spectra of five non-supergiant B stars with magnetic
fields by means of non-LTE iron-blanketed model atmospheres. The latter are
calculated with the PoWR code, which treats the photosphere as well as the the
wind, and also accounts for X-rays. Our models accurately fit the stellar
photospheric spectra in the optical and the UV. The parameters of X-ray
emission, temperature and flux are included in the model in accordance with
observations. We confirm the earlier findings that the filling factors of X-ray
emitting material are very high. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic early
type B stars studied here have weak winds. The mass-loss rates are
significantly lower than predicted by hydrodynamically consistent models. We
find that, although the X-rays strongly affect the ionization structure of the
wind, this effect is not sufficient in reducing the total radiative
acceleration. When the X-rays are accounted for at the intensity and
temperatures observed, there is still sufficient radiative acceleration to
drive stronger mass-loss than we empirically infer from the UV spectral lines.

only bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-up
searches, that are bright in the 15-150 keV Swift/BAT band, i.e. with 1-s peak
photon fluxes in excess to 2.6 ph s^-1 cm^-2. The sample is composed by 58
bursts, 52 of them with redshift for a completeness level of 90%, while another
two have a redshift constraint, reaching a completeness level of 95%. For only
three bursts we have no constraint on the redshift. The high level of redshift
completeness allows us for the first time to constrain the GRB luminosity
function and its evolution with cosmic times in a unbiased way. We find that
strong evolution in luminosity (d_l=2.3\pm 0.6) or in density (d_d=1.7\pm 0.5)
is required in order to account for the observations. The derived redshift
distribution in the two scenarios are consistent with each other, in spite of
their different intrinsic redshift distribution. This calls for other
indicators to distinguish among different evolution models. Complete samples
are at the base of any population studies. In future works we will use this

code for the optimisation of an array of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes (IACTs). The algorithm takes as input a series of cost functions
(metrics) each describing a different objetive of the optimisation (such as
effective area, angular resolution, etc.), all of which are expressed in terms
of the relative position of the telescopes in the plane. The output of the
algorithm is a family of geometrical arrangements which correspond to the
complete set of solutions to the array optimisation problem, and differ from
each other according to the relative weight given to each of the (maybe
conflicting) objetives of the optimisation. Since the algorithm works with
parallel optimisation it admits as many cost functions as desired, and can
incorporate constraints such as budget (cost cap) for the array and topological
limitations of the terrain, like geographical accidents where telescopes cannot
be installed. It also admits different types of telescopes (hybrid arrays) and
the number of telescopes of each type can be treated as a parameter to be
optimised - constrained, for example, by the cost of each type or the energy
range of interest. The purpose of the algorithm, which converges fast to
optimised solutions (if compared to the time for a complete Monte Carlo
Simulation of a single configuration), is to provide a tool to investigate the
full parameter space of possible geometries, and help in designing complex
arrays. It does not substitute a detailed Monte Carlo study, but aims to guide
it. In the examples of arrays shown here we have used as metrics simple
heuristic expressions describing the fundamentals of the IAC technique, but
these input functions can be made as detailed or complex as desired for a given

composition of its initial gas cloud -- the formation site of the star and its
planets. Planet formation requires metals, the availability of which is
determined by the elemental abundance. In the case where metals are extremely
deficient, planet formation can be stifled. To investigate such a scenario
requires a large sample of metal-poor stars and a search for planets therein.
This paper focuses on the selection and validation of a halo star sample. We
select ~17,000 metal-poor halo stars based on their Galactic kinematics, and
confirm their low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -0.5), using spectroscopy from the
literature. Furthermore, we perform high-resolution spectroscopic observations
using LBT/PEPSI and conduct detailed metallicity ([Fe/H]) analyses on a sample
of 13 previously known halo stars that also have hot kinematics. We can use the

  systems","The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario well describes the
Universe at large scales, but shows some serious difficulties at small scales:
the inner dark matter (DM) density profiles of spiral galaxies generally appear
to be cored, without the $r^{-1}$ predicted by N-body simulations in the above
scenario.
  In a more physical context, the baryons in the galaxy might backreact and
erase the original cusp through supernova explosions. Before that this effect
be investigated, it is important to determine how wide and frequent the
discrepancy between observed and N-body predicted profiles is and what its
features are. We used more than 3200 quite extended rotation curves (RCs) of
good quality and high resolution of disk systems. The curves cover all
magnitude ranges. These RCs were condensed into 26 coadded RCs, each of them
built with individual RCs of galaxies of similar luminosity and morphology. We
performed mass models of these 26 RCs using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profile for the contribution of the DM halo to the circular velocity and the
exponential Freeman disk for that of the stellar disk. The fits are generally
poor in all the 26 cases: in several cases, we find $\chi^2_{red}>2$. Moreover,
the best-fitting values of three parameters of the model ($c$, $M_D$, and
$M_{vir}$) combined with those of their 1$\sigma$ uncertainty clearly
contradict well-known expectations of the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We also tested
the scaling relations that exist in spirals with the fitting outcome: the
modeling does not account for these scaling relations.
  Therefore, NFW halo density law cannot account for the kinematics of the
whole family of disk galaxies. It is therefore mandatory for the $\Lambda CDM$

magnetar flares wherein a tangled component of the stellar magnetic field
introduces nearly isotropic stress that gives the fluid core of the star an
effective shear modulus. In a simple, illustrative model of constant density,
the tangled field eliminates the problematic Alfv\'en continuum that would
exist in the stellar core for an organized field. For a tangled field energy
density comparable to that inferred from the measured dipole fields of $\sim
10^{15}$ G in SGRs 1806-20 and 1900+14, torsional modes exist with fundamental
frequencies of about 20 Hz, and mode spacings of $\sim 10$ Hz. For fixed
stellar mass and radius, the model has only one free parameter, and can account
for {\em every} observed QPO under 160 Hz to within 3 Hz for both SGRs 1806-20
and 1900+14. The combined effects of stratification and crust stresses
generally decrease the frequencies of torsional oscillations by $<10$% for
overtones and increase the lowest-frequency fundamentals by up to 50%, and so
the star can be treated as having constant density to a generally good first
approximation. We address the issue of mode excitation by sudden readjustment
of the stellar magnetosphere. While the total energy in excited modes is well
within the energy budget of giant flares, the surface amplitude is $< 10^{-3}$
of the stellar radius for global oscillations, and decreases strongly with mode
frequency. The 626 Hz QPO reported for SGR 1806-20 is particularly problematic
to excite beyond a surface amplitude of $10^{-6}$ of the stellar radius.","[{'name': 'Bennett Link'}, {'name': 'C. Anthony van Eysden'}]","14 pages, 3 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01410v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01410v1,astro-ph.SR,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.HE']",,

  Breaking Degeneracies between Halo Occupation Distribution Models","Recent work on quasar clustering suggests a degeneracy in the halo occupation
distribution constrained from two-point correlation functions. To break this
degeneracy, we make the first empirical measurement of the mean occupation
function (MOF) of quasars at $z \sim 0.2$ by matching quasar positions with
groups and clusters identified in the MaxBCG sample. We fit two models to the
MOF, a power law and a 4-parameter model. The number distribution of quasars in
host halos is close to Poisson, and the slopes of the MOF obtained from our
best-fit models (for the power law case) favor a MOF that monotonically
increases with halo mass. The best-fit slopes are $0.53 \pm 0.04$ and $1.03\pm
1.12$ for the power law model and the 4-parameter model, respectively. We
measure the radial distribution of quasars within dark matter halos and find it
to be adequately described by a power law with a slope $-2.3 \pm 0.4$. We
measure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) of quasars and show that
there is no evidence that quasar luminosity depends on host halo mass, similar
to the inferences drawn from clustering measurements. We also measure the
conditional black hole mass function (CMF) of our quasars. Although the results
are consistent with no dependence on halo mass, we observe a slight indication
of downsizing of the black hole mass function. The lack of halo mass dependence
in the CLF and CMF shows that quasars residing in galaxy clusters have
characteristic luminosity and black hole mass scales.","[{'name': 'Suchetana Chatterjee', 'affiliation': 'UniWyo'}, {'name': 'My Nguyen', 'affiliation': 'UniWyo'}, {'name': 'Adam Myers', 'affiliation': 'UniWyo'}, {'name': 'Zheng Zheng', 'affiliation': 'Utah'}]","Matches the ApJ accepted version (11 pages, 8 figures)",http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3607v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/779/2/147', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.3607v2']",astro-ph.CO,['astro-ph.CO'],10.1088/0004-637X/779/2/147,

  evolution calculations","We present a new 2D axisymmetric code, cuDisc, for studying protoplanetary
discs, focusing on the self-consistent calculation of dust dynamics, grain size
distribution and disc temperature. Self-consistently studying these physical
processes is essential for many disc problems, such as structure formation and
dust removal, given that the processes heavily depend on one another. To follow
the evolution over substantial fractions of the disc lifetime, cuDisc uses the
CUDA language and libraries to speed up the code through GPU acceleration.
cuDisc employs a second-order finite-volume Godonuv solver for dust dynamics,
solves the Smoluchowski equation for dust growth and calculates radiative
transfer using a multi-frequency hybrid ray-tracing/flux-limited-diffusion
method. We benchmark our code against current state-of-the-art codes. Through
studying steady-state problems, we find that including 2D structure reveals
that when collisions are important, the dust vertical structure appears to
reach a diffusion-settling-coagulation equilibrium that can differ
substantially from standard models that ignore coagulation. For low
fragmentation velocities, we find an enhancement of intermediate-sized dust
grains at heights of ~ 1 gas scale height due to the variation in collision
rates with height, and for large fragmentation velocities, we find an
enhancement of small grains around the disc mid-plane due to collisional
''sweeping'' of small grains by large grains. These results could be important
for the analysis of disc SEDs or scattered light images, given these
observables are sensitive to the vertical grain distribution.","[{'name': 'Alfie Robinson'}, {'name': 'Richard A. Booth'}, {'name': 'James E. Owen'}]","18 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS. GitHub repository link:

Kepler-35 b) have recently been discovered from photometric data taken by the
Kepler spacecraft. Their orbits are significantly non-Keplerian because of the
large secondary-to-primary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity of the binaries,
as well as the proximity of the planets to the binaries. We present an analytic
theory, with the planet treated as a test particle, which shows that the
planetary motion can be represented by the superposition of the circular motion
of a guiding center, the forced oscillations due to the non-axisymmetric
components of the binary's potential, the epicyclic motion, and the vertical
motion. In this analytic theory, the periapse and ascending node of the planet
precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The largest forced
oscillation term corresponds to a forced eccentricity (which is an explicit
function of the parameters of the binary and of the guiding center radius of
the planet), and the amplitude of the epicyclic motion (which is a free
parameter of the theory) is the free eccentricity. Comparisons with direct
numerical orbit integrations show that this analytic theory gives an accurate
description of the planetary motion for all three Kepler systems. We find that
all three Kepler circumbinary planets have nonzero free eccentricities.","[{'name': 'Gene C. K.

  bulges using the CALIFA sample","Understanding the nature of bulges in disc galaxies can provide important
insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies. For instance, the
presence of a classical bulge suggests a relatively violent history, in
contrast, the presence of simply an inner disc (also referred to as a
""pseudobulge"") indicates the occurrence of secular evolution processes in the
main disc. However, we still lack criteria to effectively categorise bulges,
limiting our ability to study their impact on the evolution of the host
galaxies. Here we present a recipe to separate inner discs from classical
bulges by combining four different parameters from photometric and kinematic
analyses: The bulge S\'ersic index $n_\mathrm{b}$, the concentration index
$C_{20,50}$, the Kormendy (1977) relation and the inner slope of the radial
velocity dispersion profile $\nabla\sigma$. With that recipe we provide a
detailed bulge classification for a sample of 45 galaxies from the
integral-field spectroscopic survey CALIFA. To aid in categorising bulges
within these galaxies, we perform 2D image decomposition to determine bulge
S\'ersic index, bulge-to-total light ratio, surface brightness and effective
radius of the bulge and use growth curve analysis to derive a new concentration
index, $C_{20,50}$. We further extract the stellar kinematics from CALIFA data
cubes and analyse the radial velocity dispersion profile. The results of the
different approaches are in good agreement and allow a safe classification for
approximately $95\%$ of the galaxies. In particular, we show that our new
""inner"" concentration index performs considerably better than the traditionally
used $C_{50,90}$ when yielding the nature of bulges. We also found that a
combined use of this index and the Kormendy (1977) relation gives a very robust
indication of the physical nature of the bulge.","[{'name': 'J. Neumann'}, {'name': 'L. Wisotzki'}, {'name': 'O. S. Choudhury'}, {'name': 'D. A. Gadotti'}, {'name': 'C. J. Walcher'}, {'name': 'J.

accretion rates than the stability limit, \dot M_stable, above which hydrogen
burning is stable. Novae occur with mass accretion rates below the limit. For
an accretion rate > \dot M_stable, a first hydrogen shell flash occurs followed
by steady nuclear burning, so the shell burning will not be quenched as long as
the WD continuously accretes matter. On the basis of this picture, some
persistent supersoft X-ray sources can be explained by binary models with high
accretion rates. In some recent studies, however, the claim has been made that
no steady hydrogen shell burning exists even for accretion rates > \dot M_{\rm
stable}. We demonstrate that, in such cases, repetitive flashes occurred
because mass accretion was artificially controlled. If we stop mass accretion
during the outburst, no new nuclear fuel is supplied, so the shell burning will
eventually stop. If we resume mass accretion after some time, the next outburst
eventually occurs. In this way, we can design the duration of outburst and
interpulse time with manipulated mass accretion. We call such a controlled nova
a ""forced nova."" These forced novae, if they exist, could have much shorter
recurrence periods than ""natural novae."" We have obtained the shortest
recurrence periods for forced novae for various WD masses. Based on the
results, we revisit WD masses of some recurrent novae including T Pyx.","[{'name': 'Izumi Hachisu', 'affiliation': 'Univ. of Tokyo'}, {'name': 'Hideyuki Saio', 'affiliation': 'Tohoku Univ.'}, {'name': 'Mariko Kato', 'affiliation': 'Keio Univ.'}]","10 pages, 10 figures, to appear in the Astrophysical Journal",http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02965v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/824/1/22', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02965v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.3847/0004-637X/824/1/22,

four-color (B, V , Rc, Ic) light curves (LCs) were obtained. Using the 2013
version of the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code, we analyzed these data. The
photometric solutions reveal that NSVS 01286630 is an active detached eclipsing
binary (EB) with a high orbit inclination. Remarkably, the temperature of the
primary component (the hotter star) is higher than the secondary one, but, the
value of mass ratio q(M2/M1) for NSVS 0128663 is more than 1, which can be
explained that the surface of the secondary component of NSVS 01286630 is
covered with big cool-star-spots. Based on our new CCD mid-eclipse times and
the data published until now, the variations of the mid-eclipse times were
reanalyzed in detail using a weighted least-squares method. It is discovered
that the (O-C) diagram of the system shows a cyclic oscillation with a period
of 3.61 yr and an amplitude of 0.001 days. The cyclic variation may be caused
by the light travel time effect (LTTE) due to the presence of a third
companion, whose mass we calculated is about 0.11 solar mass. The third body
may affect the orbital evolution of the central binary system by transferring
the angular momentum.","[{'name': 'Bin Zhang'}, {'name': 'Sheng-bang Qian'}, {'name': 'Wen-ping Liao'}, {'name': 'Li-ying Zhu'}, {'name': 'Ai-jun Dong'}, {'name': 'Qi-jun Zhi'}]","12 pages, 5 figures, accepted by RAA",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04978v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-4527/18/9/116', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04978v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.1088/1674-4527/18/9/116,

to two physical effects: selective extinction by dust grains aligned with the
magnetic field, and scattering of the anisotropic starlight field. Since the
reflection and transmission coefficients of the reflecting and refracting
surfaces in an optical system depend on the polarization of incoming rays, this
optical polarization produces both (a) a selection bias in favor of galaxies
with specific orientations and (b) a polarization-dependent PSF. In this work
we build toy models to obtain for the first time an estimate for the impact of
polarization on PSF shapes and the impact of the selection bias due to the
polarization effect on the measurement of the ellipticity used in shear
measurements. In particular, we are interested in determining if this effect
will be significant for WFIRST. We show that the systematic uncertainties in
the ellipticity components are $8\times 10^{-5}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{-4}$ due
to the selection bias and PSF errors respectively. Compared to the overall
requirements on knowledge of the WFIRST PSF ellipticity ($4.7\times 10^{-4}$
per component), both of these systematic uncertainties are sufficiently close
to the WFIRST tolerance level that more detailed studies of the polarization
effects or more stringent requirements on polarization-sensitive
instrumentation for WFIRST are required.","[{'name': 'Chien-Hao Lin'}, {'name': 'Brent Tan'}, {'name': 'Rachel Mandelbaum'}, {'name': 'Christopher M.

thick disks formed by: i) accretion from disrupted satellites, ii) heating of a

rich mergers. We find that the distribution of orbital eccentricities are
predicted to be different for each model: a prominent peak at low eccentricity
is expected for the heating, migration and gas-rich merging scenarios, while
the eccentricity distribution is broader and shifted towards higher values for
the accretion model. These differences can be traced back to whether the bulk
of the stars in each case is formed 'in-situ' or is 'accreted', and are robust
to the peculiarities of each model. A simple test based on the eccentricity
distribution of nearby thick disk stars may thus help elucidate the dominant

very young stars orbiting the central super-massive black hole within a
distance of a few 0.1 pc. While it is widely accepted that about half of the
stars form a relatively flat disc rotating clockwise on the sky, there is a
substantial ongoing debate on whether there is a second, counter-clockwise disc
of stars.
  By means of N-body simulations using our bhint code, we show that two highly
inclined stellar discs with the observed properties cannot be recognised as two
flat circular discs after 5 Myr of mutual interaction. Instead, our
calculations predict a significant warping of the two discs, which we show to
be apparent among the structures observed in the Galactic Centre. While the
high eccentricities of the observed counter-clockwise orbits suggest an
eccentric origin of this system, we show the eccentricity distribution in the
inner part of the more massive clockwise disc to be perfectly consistent with
an initially circular disc in which stellar eccentricities increase due to both
non-resonant and resonant relaxation.
  We conclude that the relevant question to ask is therefore not whether there
are two discs of young stars, but whether there were two such discs to begin
with.","[{'name': 'Ulf Löckmann'}, {'name': 'Holger Baumgardt'}]","6 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters",http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1660v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14466.x', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.1660v1']",astro-ph.GA,['astro-ph.GA'],10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14466.x,

disks. With models, we show that the rate of the decay varies throughout the
evolution of the disks, increasing its rate up to a certain point, which is
followed by a leveling off to a slower value. The total disk mass falls off ~
t^-0.35 at its fastest point (where t is time) for our reference model, while
the dust mass and its proxy -- the infrared excess emission -- fades
significantly faster (~ t^-0.8). These later level off to a decay rate of
M_tot(t) ~ t^-0.08 and M_dust(t) or L_ir(t) ~ t^-0.6. This is slower than the ~
t^-1 decay given for all three system parameters by traditional analytic
models.
  We also compile an extensive catalog of Spitzer and Herschel 24, 70, and 100
micron observations. Assuming a log-normal distribution of initial disk masses,
we generate model population decay curves for the fraction of debris disk
harboring stars observed at 24 micron and also model the distribution of
measured excesses at the far-IR wavelengths (70-100 micron) at certain age
regimes. We show general agreement at 24 micron between the decay of our
numerical collisional population synthesis model and observations up to a Gyr.
We associate offsets above a Gyr to stochastic events in a few select systems.
We cannot fit the decay in the far infrared convincingly with grain strength
properties appropriate for silicates, but those of water ice give fits more
consistent with the observations.","[{'name': 'Andras Gaspar'}, {'name': 'George H. Rieke'}, {'name': 'Zoltan Balog'}]","32 pages, 16 figures, emulateapj format, Accepted for publication in

  Eccentric Compact Binaries","Mergers of compact binaries, such as binary neutron stars (BNSs), neutron
star-black hole binaries (NSBHs), and binary black holes (BBHs), are expected
to be the best candidates for the sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and the
leading theoretical models for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Based on the
observations of SGRBs, we could derive the merger rates of these compact
binaries, and study the stochastic GW backgrounds (SGWBs) or the co-detection
rates of GWs associate with SGRBs (GW-SGRBs). But before that, the most
important thing is to derive the GW spectrum from a single GW source. Usually,
GW spectrum from a circular orbit binary is assumed. However, observations of
the large spatial offsets of SGRBs from their host galaxies imply that SGRB
progenitors may be formed by the dynamical processes, and will merge with
residual eccentricities. The orbital eccentricity has important effect on GW
spectra, and therefore on the SGWB and GW-SGRB co-detection rate. Our results
show that the power spectra of the SGWBs from eccentric compact binaries are
greatly suppressed at low frequencies. Especially, SGWBs from binaries with
high residual eccentricities will hard to be detected (above the detection
frequency of $\sim100~\rm Hz$). For the co-detection rates of GW-SGRB events,
they could be $\sim1.4$ times higher than the circular case within some
particular ranges of $e_{\rm r}$ , but greatly reduced for high residual
eccentricities (e.g., $e_{\rm r}>0.1$ for BNSs). In general, the BBH
progenitors produce 200 and 10 times higher GW-SGRB events than the BNS and
NSBH progenitors, respectively. Therefore, binaries with low residual
eccentricities and high total masses will easier to be detected by aLIGO.","[{'name': 'Wei-Wei Tan', 'affiliation': 'NJU'}, {'name': 'Xi-Long Fan', 'affiliation': 'NJU'}, {'name': 'F. Y.

SN 1006 remnant, carried out with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The 24 micron
image from MIPS clearly shows faint filamentary emission along the northwest
rim of the remnant shell, nearly coincident with the Balmer filaments that
delineate the present position of the expanding shock. The 24 micron emission
traces the Balmer filaments almost perfectly, but lies a few arcsec within,
indicating an origin in interstellar dust heated by the shock. Subsequent
decline in the IR behind the shock is presumably due largely to grain
destruction through sputtering. The emission drops far more rapidly than
current models predict, however, even for a higher proportion of small grains
than would be found closer to the Galactic plane. The rapid drop may result in
part from a grain density that has always been lower -- a relic effect from an
earlier epoch when the shock was encountering a lower density -- but higher
grain destruction rates still seem to be required. Spectra from three positions
along the NW filament from the IRS instrument all show only a featureless
continuum, consistent with thermal emission from warm dust. The dust-to-gas
mass ratio in the pre-shock interstellar medium is lower than that expected for
the Galactic ISM -- as has also been observed in the analysis of IR emission
from other SNRs but whose cause remains unclear. As with other SN Ia remnants,

investigated. First passage time techniques are employed to calculate the
statistical moments of the number of inflationary $e$-folds, which give rise to
all correlation functions of primordial curvature perturbations through the
stochastic $\delta N$ formalism. The number of fields is a critical parameter.
The probability of exploring arbitrarily large-field regions of the potential
becomes non-vanishing when more than two fields are driving inflation. The mean
number of $e$-folds can be infinite, depending on the number of fields; for
plateau potentials, this occurs even with one field. In such cases, correlation
functions of curvature perturbations are infinite. They can, however, be
regularised if a reflecting (or absorbing) wall is added at large energy or
field value. The results are found to be independent of the exact location of
the wall and this procedure is, therefore, well-defined for a wide range of
cutoffs, above or below the Planck scale. Finally, we show that, contrary to
single-field setups, multi-field models can yield large stochastic corrections
even at sub-Planckian energy, opening interesting prospects for probing quantum
effects on cosmological fluctuations.","[{'name': 'Vincent Vennin'}, {'name': 'Hooshyar Assadullahi'}, {'name': 'Hassan Firouzjahi'}, {'name': 'Mahdiyar Noorbala'}, {'name': 'David Wands'}]","5 pages, 2 figures, matches published version in Physical Review

phenomenon is high and discriminating between them is a must-do. In this work
we explore the influence of rotation in the evolution of the nuclear flame
which drives the explosion in the so called gravitational confined detonation
models. Assuming that the flame starts in a point-like region slightly above
the center of the white dwarf (WD) and adding a moderate amount of angular
velocity to the star we follow the evolution of the deflagration using a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. We find that the results are very
dependent on the angle between the rotational axis and the line connecting the
initial bubble of burned material with the center of the white dwarf at the
moment of the ignition. The impact of rotation is larger for angles close to
90{\deg} because the Coriolis force on a floating element of fluid is maximum,
and its principal effect is to break the symmetry of the deflagration. Such
symmetry breaking weakens the convergence of the nuclear flame at the antipodes
of the initial ignition volume, changing the environmental conditions around
the convergence region with respect to non-rotating models. These changes seem
to disfavor the emergence of a detonation in the compressed volume at the
antipodes, thus compromising the viability of the so called gravitational
confined detonation mechanism.","[{'name': 'D. García-Senz'}, {'name': 'R. M. Cabezón'}, {'name': 'I. Domínguez'}, {'name': 'F. K.

planetary system containing a Super-Earth and a gas giant, both embedded in a

enough precise, the detection is possible. The planned Ariel space observatory
is designed to achieve a stability of < 100 ppm (the goal is 10 ppm) over the
temporal bandwidth of the transit, typically less than 10 hours. In this case
study we took the disintegrating exoplanet Kepler-1520b and changed the orbital
properties of the system to get a grazing, non-transiting orbit scenario, and
investigated, how different particle sizes, species, Ariel observational
channels, and other factors affect the amplitude of the forward-scattering
peak, and the detectability of the scattering event. Our most important result
is that the forward-scattering amplitude is not sensitive to the dust
composition, but is very sensitive to the particle size, observational channel,
and other factors. These factors can reduce mainly the detectability of
1-micron grains. 0.1-micron grains will be detectable at short wavelengths.
0.01-micron grains generate long and very small forward scattering amplitude,
which is below the detection limit. Based on our results we can conclude that
using Ariel will be possible to detect and investigate not only transiting, but
also grazing, non-transiting disintegrating exoplanets based on the forward
scattering. From the viewpoint of such objects the big advantage of Ariel will
be the possibility of multiwavelength observations.",{'name': 'Zoltán Garai'},"This is a post-peer-review, pre-copyedit version of an article

  Spectroscopic Data","We present the data reduction software and the distribution of Level 1 and
Level 2 products of the Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory 2 (STO2). STO2, a
balloon-borne Terahertz telescope, surveyed star-forming regions and the
Galactic plane and produced approximately 300,000 spectra. The data are largely
similar to spectra typically produced by single-dish radio telescopes. However,
a fraction of the data contained rapidly varying fringe/baseline features and
drift noise, which could not be adequately corrected using conventional data
reduction software. To process the entire science data of the STO2 mission, we
have adopted a new method to find proper off-source spectra to reduce
large-amplitude fringes and new algorithms including Asymmetric Least Square
(ALS), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Density-based spatial
clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The STO2 data reduction
software efficiently reduced the amplitude of fringes from a few hundred to 10
K and resulted in baselines of amplitude down to a few K. The Level 1 products
typically have the noise of a few K in [CII] spectra and ~1 K in [NII] spectra.
Using a regridding algorithm, we made spectral maps of star-forming regions and
the Galactic plane survey using an algorithm employing a Bessel-Gaussian
kernel. Level 1 and 2 products are available to the astronomical community
through the STO2 data server and the DataVerse. The software is also accessible
to the public through Github. The detailed addresses are given in Section 4 of
the paper on data distribution.","[{'name': 'Young Min Seo'}, {'name': 'Paul F.

skew. In the past this skewness has been modelled by superposed Gaussians. We
use dynamical arguments to derive an analytic formula that can be fitted to
observed velocity distributions, and validate it by fits to the velocities
derived from a dynamically rigorous model, and to a sample of local stars with
accurate space velocities. Our formula is much easier to use than a full
distribution function. It has fewer parameters than a multi-Gaussian fit, and
the best-fitting model parameters give insight into the underlying disc
dynamics. In particular, once the azimuthal velocities of a sample have been
successfully fitted, the apparatus provides a prediction for the corresponding
distribution of radial velocities vR . An effective formula like ours is
invaluable when fitting to data for stars at some distance from the Sun because
it enables one to make proper allowance for the errors in distance and proper
motion when determining the underlying disc kinematics. The derivation of our
formula elucidates the way the horizontal and vertical motions are closely
intertwined, and makes it evident that no stellar population can have a scale
height and vertical velocity dispersions that are simultaneously independent of
radius. We show that the oscillation of a star perpendicular to the Galactic
plane modifies the effective potential in which the star moves radially in such
a way that the more vertical energy a star has, the larger is the mean radius
of its orbit.","[{'name': 'Ralph Schoenrich'}, {'name': 'James Binney'}]","11 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables accepted by MNRAS",http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4417v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19816.x', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4417v1']",astro-ph.GA,['astro-ph.GA'],10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19816.x,

rapid-neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. However, in Galactic
chemical evolution models, neutron-star mergers alone cannot reproduce the
observed element abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars, which
indicates the existence of other sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. These
sites may be investigated by studying the element abundance patterns of
chemically primitive stars in the halo of the Milky Way, because these objects
retain the nucleosynthetic signatures of the earliest generation of stars. Here
we report the element abundance pattern of the extremely metal-poor star SMSS

very low overall metallicity. The element abundance pattern is well matched by
the yields of a single 25-solar-mass magnetorotational hypernova. Such a
hypernova could produce not only the r-process elements, but also light
elements during stellar evolution, and iron-peak elements during explosive
nuclear burning. Hypernovae are often associated with long-duration gamma-ray
bursts in the nearby Universe. This connection indicates that similar
explosions of fast-spinning strongly magnetized stars occurred during the

  Ammonia Inversion Lines","Although ammonia is a widely used interstellar thermometer, the estimation of
its rotational and kinetic temperatures can be affected by the blended
Hyperfine Components (HFCs). We developed a new recipe, referred to as the
HyperFine Group Ratio (HFGR), which utilizes only direct observables, namely
the intensity ratios between the grouped HFCs. As tested on the model spectra,
the empirical formulae in HFGR can derive the rotational temperature ($T_{\rm
rot}$) from the HFC group ratios in an unambiguous manner. We compared HFGR
with two other classical methods, intensity ratio and hyperfine fitting, based
on both simulated spectra and real data. HFGR has three major improvements.
First, HFGR does not require modeling the HFC or fitting the line profiles,
thus is more robust against the effect of HFC blending. Second, the
simulation-enabled empirical formulae are much faster than fitting the spectra
over the parameter space, so the computer time and human time can be both
largely saved. Third, the statistical uncertainty of the temperature $\Delta
T_{\rm rot}$ as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a natural
product of the HFGR recipe. The internal error of HFGR is $\Delta T_{\rm
rot}\leq0.5$ K over a broad parameter space of rotational temperature (10 to 60
K), line width (0.3 to 4 km/s), and optical depth (0 to 5). When there is a
spectral noise, HFGR can also maintain a reasonable uncertainty level at
$\Delta T_{\rm rot}\leq 1.0$ K (1 $\sigma$) when SNR > 4.","[{'name': 'Shen Wang'}, {'name': 'Zhiyuan Ren'}, {'name': 'Di Li'}, {'name': 'Jens Kauffmann'}, {'name': 'Qizhou Zhang'}, {'name': 'Hui Shi'}]",,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05229v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa3059', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05229v2']",astro-ph.GA,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.SR']",10.1093/mnras/staa3059,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 499,

at Earth. It is an unusual stream in that its parent body is understood to be
an asteroid, (3200) Phaethon, unlike most streams which are formed via ongoing
cometary activity. Until recently, our primary understanding of this stream
came from Earth-based measurements of the Geminids meteor shower. However, the
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft has transited near the core of the stream
close to its perihelion and provides a new platform to better understand this
unique stream. Here, we create a dynamical model of the Geminids meteoroid
stream, calibrate its total density to Earth-based measurements, and compare
this model to recent observations of the dust environment near the Sun by PSP.
For the formation mechanisms considered, we find the core of the meteoroid
stream predominantly lies interior to its parent body orbit and expect grains
in the stream to be $\gtrsim$10 $\mu$m in radius. Data-model comparisons of the
location of the stream relative to Phaethon's orbit are more consistent with a
catastrophic formation scenario, in contrast to cometary formation. Finally,
while PSP transits very near the core of the stream, the impact rate expected
by Geminids meteoroids is orders of magnitude below the impact rates observed
by PSP, and hence undetectable in-situ. We similarly expect the upcoming
DESTINY+ mission to be unable to detect appreciable quantities of Geminids

  Density Probability Distribution Function in Molecular Clouds","Simulations generally show that non-self-gravitating clouds have a lognormal
column density ($\Sigma$) probability distribution function (PDF), while
self-gravitating clouds with active star formation develop a distinct power-law
tail at high column density. Although the growth of the power law can be
attributed to gravitational contraction leading to the formation of condensed
cores, it is often debated if an observed lognormal shape is a direct
consequence of supersonic turbulence alone, or even if it is really observed in
molecular clouds. In this paper we run three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
simulations including ambipolar diffusion with different initial conditions to
see the effect of strong magnetic fields and nonlinear initial velocity
perturbations on the evolution of the column density PDFs. Our simulations show
that column density PDFs of clouds with supercritical mass-to-flux ratio, with
either linear perturbations or nonlinear turbulence, quickly develop a
power-law tail such that $dN/d \log \Sigma \propto \Sigma^{-\alpha}$ with index
$\alpha \simeq 2$. Interestingly, clouds with subcritical mass-to-flux ratio
also proceed directly to a power-law PDF, but with a much steeper index $\alpha
\simeq 4$. This is a result of gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion.
However, for nonlinear perturbations with a turbulent spectrum ($v_{k}^{2}
\propto k^{-4}$), the column density PDFs of subcritical clouds do retain a
lognormal shape for a major part of the cloud evolution, and only develop a
distinct power-law tail with index $\alpha \simeq 2$ at greater column density
when supercritical pockets are formed.","[{'name': 'Sayantan Auddy'}, {'name': 'Shantanu Basu'}, {'name': 'Takahiro Kudoh'}]","12 pages, 12 figures, to appear in MNRAS",http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05427v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2740', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05427v1']",astro-ph.GA,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.SR']",10.1093/mnras/stx2740,

fractions of heavy elements are $Z_{\rm b}/Z_{\rm c}=1.02\pm 0.14$, indicating
that, although the masses of the planets differ, their global composition is
very similar, an unexpected result for formation models. Using evolution models
for super-Earths, we find that Kepler-9d must contain less than 0.1% of its
mass in hydrogen and helium and predict a mostly rocky structure with a total
mass between 4 and 16\,\mearth.","[{'name': 'Mathieu Havel', 'affiliation': 'CASSIOPEE'}, {'name': 'Tristan Guillot', 'affiliation': 'CASSIOPEE'}, {'name': 'Diana Valencia', 'affiliation': 'CASSIOPEE'}, {'name': 'Aurélien Crida', 'affiliation': 'CASSIOPEE'}]","5 pages + 7 pages of online material ; revised article submitted to

none of the spectral features in the ISM have been assigned to this molecule.
We suggest that iron atoms interact with hydrogen and produce Fe-H
nanoparticles which sometimes contain many H atoms. We calculate infrared
spectra of hydrogenated iron nanoparticles using density functional theory
methods and find broad, overlapping bands. Desorption of H2 could induce
spinning of these small Fe-H dust grains. Some of hydrogenated iron
nanoparticles posses magnetic and electric moments and should interact with
electromagnetic fields in the ISM. Fe_nH_m nanoparticles could contribute to
the polarization of the ISM and the anomalous microwave emission. We discuss
the conditions required to form FeH and Fe_nH_m in the ISM.","[{'name': 'G. Bilalbegovic'}, {'name': 'A. Maksimovic'}, {'name': 'V.

  1","B2 0954+25A, detected by the {\it Fermi} satellite, is a blazar with
interesting observational properties: it has been observed to transit from a
jet dominated to a disk dominated state; its radio spectrum appears flat at all
observing frequencies (down to 74 MHz); optically, the H$\beta$ line profile is
asymmetric. The flatness of radio spectrum suggests that the isotropic emission
from radio lobes is very weak, despite the large size of its jet ($\gtrsim$ 500
kpc). Its broad--band spectral energy distribution is surprisingly similar to
that of the prototypical $\gamma$--ray, radio loud, Narrow Line Seyfert 1
($\gamma$--NLS1) galaxy PMN J0948+0022. In this work we revisit the mass
estimates of B2 0954+25A considering only the symmetric component of the
H$\beta$ line and find (1--3) $\times 10^8$ M$_{\sun}$. In light of our
composite analysis, we propose to classify the source as a transition object
between the class of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar and $\gamma$--ray, radio loud
NLS1. A comparison with two members of each class (3C 273 and PMN J0948+0022)
is discussed.","[{'name': 'G. Calderone'}, {'name': 'G. Ghisellini'}, {'name': 'M. Colpi'}, {'name': 'M.

  using data from LIGO Science Run 5 and Virgo Science Run 1","We present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associated
with 137 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were detected by satellite-based
gamma-ray experiments during the fifth LIGO science run and first Virgo science
run. The data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 November 4 to 2007
October 1, and most of the GRB triggers were from the Swift satellite. The
search uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account the
different locations and orientations of the interferometers at the three
LIGO-Virgo sites. We find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signals
associated with this sample of GRBs. Using simulated short-duration (<1 s)
waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves
associated with each GRB. We also place lower bounds on the distance to each
GRB under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,
with typical limits of D ~ 15 Mpc (E_GW^iso / 0.01 M_o c^2)^1/2 for emission at
frequencies around 150 Hz, where the LIGO-Virgo detector network has best
sensitivity. We present astrophysical interpretations and implications of these
results, and prospects for corresponding searches during future LIGO-Virgo
runs.","[{'name': 'LIGO Scientific Collaboration'}, {'name': 'Virgo Collaboration'}, {'name': 'B. P. Abbott'}, {'name': 'R. Abbott'}, {'name': 'F. Acernese'}, {'name': 'R. Adhikari'}, {'name': 'P.

25, 2016, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is
being busily commissioned. Its innovative design requires ~1000 points to be
measured and driven instead of just the two axes of motion, e.g. Azimuth and
Elevation for most of the conventional antennae, to realize pointing and
tracking. We have devised a survey plan to utilized the full sensitivity of
FAST, while minimizing the complexities in operation the system. The 19-beam L
band focal plan array will be rotated to specific angles and taking continuous
data streams while the surface shape and the focal cabin stay fixed. Such a
survey will cover the northern sky in about 220 full days. Our aim is to obtain
data for pulsar search, HI (neutral hydrogen) galaxies, HI imaging, and radio
transients, simultaneously, through multiple backends. These data sets could be
a significant contribution to all related fields in radio astronomy and remain

cool the gas down to the CMB temperature for a metallicity of

stars. Overall, we find that the metals have a stronger effect on the collapse
than the radiation, yielding a comparable thermal structure for large
variations in the radiative background. We further find that radiative

detected in the 69 arcmin^2 GOODS-ALMA 1.1mm continuum survey. While none of
them are listed in the deepest H-band based CANDELS catalog in the GOODS-South
field down to H=28.16AB, we were able to de-blend two of them from their bright
neighbor and measure an $H$-band flux for them. We note that AGS4 and AGS15
have H=25.23, 27.11AB respectively. Their extreme proximity (0.50"", 0.27"") to a
bright optical source and their extreme faintness prevented them from being
included in the H-band catalog. We present the spectroscopic scan follow-up of
five of the six sources with ALMA band 4. All are detected in the 2mm continuum
with signal-to-noise ratios higher than eight. One emission line is detected in
AGS4 (\nu_{obs} =151.44GHz with a S/N=8.58) and AGS17 (\nu_{obs} =154.78GHz
with a S/N=10.23), which we interpret in both cases as being due to the CO(6-5)
line at z^{AGS4}_{spec}=3.556 and z^{AGS4}_{spec}=3.467, respectively. These
redshifts match both the probability distribution of the photometric redshifts
derived from the UV to near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
the far-infrared SEDs for typical dust temperatures of galaxies at these
redshifts. We present evidence that nearly 70% (4/6 of galaxies) of the
optically dark galaxies belong to the same overdensity of galaxies at z~3.5.
overdensity The most massive one, AGS24 (M_{\star} = 10^{11.32^{+0.02}_{-0.19}}

of the galaxy surface density, which suggests that the surrounding overdensity
is a proto-cluster in the process of virialization and that AGS24 is the

Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) localization. Discovered and characterized by the
intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), iPTF13bxl is the first afterglow
discovered solely based on a GBM localization. Real-time image subtraction,
machine learning, human vetting, and rapid response multi-wavelength follow-up
enabled us to quickly narrow a list of 27,004 optical transient candidates to a
single afterglow-like source. Detection of a new, fading X-ray source by Swift
and a radio counterpart by CARMA and the VLA confirmed the association between
iPTF13bxl and GRB 130702A. Spectroscopy with the Magellan and Palomar 200-inch
telescopes showed the afterglow to be at a redshift of z=0.145, placing GRB
130702A among the lowest redshift GRBs detected to date. The prompt gamma-ray
energy release and afterglow luminosity are intermediate between typical
cosmological GRBs and nearby sub-luminous events such as GRB 980425 and GRB

extensive panchromatic follow-up. Our discovery of iPTF13bxl demonstrates the

using number counts of red clump giants (RCGs) from the OGLE-III survey. The
data were recently published by Nataf et al. (2013) for 9019 fields towards the
bulge and have $2.94\times 10^6$ RC stars over a viewing area of $90.25
\,\textrm{deg}^2$. The data include the number counts, mean distance modulus
($\mu$), dispersion in $\mu$ and full error matrix, from which we fit the data
with several tri-axial parametric models. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) method to explore the parameter space and find that the best-fit model
is the $E_3$ model, with the distance to the GC is 8.13 kpc, the ratio of
semi-major and semi-minor bar axis scale lengths in the Galactic plane
$x_{0},y_{0}$, and vertical bar scale length $z_0$, is $x_0:y_0:z_0 \approx
1.00:0.43:0.40$ (close to being prolate). The scale length of the stellar
density profile along the bar's major axis is $\sim$ 0.67 kpc and has an angle
of $29.4^\circ$, slightly larger than the value obtained from a similar study
based on OGLE-II data. The number of estimated RC stars within the field of
view is $2.78 \times 10^6$, which is systematically lower than the observed
value. We subtract the smooth parametric model from the observed counts and
find that the residuals are consistent with the presence of an X-shaped
structure in the Galactic centre, the excess to the estimated mass content is
$\sim 5.8%$. We estimate the total mass of the bar is $\sim 1.8 \times 10^{10}

models of the Milky Way and will have implications on the predictions of the

  Wavelengths","Phase resolved observations of planetary bodies allow us to understand the
longitudinal and latitudinal variations that make each one unique. Rotational
variations have been detected in several types of astronomical bodies beyond
those of planetary mass, including asteroids, brown dwarfs, and stars.
Unexpected rotational variations, such as those presented in this work, reminds
us that the universe can be complicated, with more mysteries to uncover. In
this work we present evidence for a new class of astronomical objects we
identify as ""floofy"" with observational distinctions between several sub-types
of these poorly understood objects. Using optical observations contributed by
the community, we have identified rotational variation in several of these
floofy objects, which suggests that they may have strong differences between
their hemispheres, likely caused by differing reflectivity off their surfaces.
Additional sub-types show no rotational variability suggesting a uniform
distribution of reflective elements on the floofy object. While the work here
is a promising step towards the categorization of floofy objects, further
observations with more strictly defined limits on background light,
illumination angles, and companion objects are necessary to develop a better
understanding of the many remaining mysteries of these astronomical objects.","[{'name': 'L. C. Mayorga'}, {'name': 'E. M. May'}, {'name': 'J. Lustig-Yaeger'}, {'name': 'S. E Moran'}]","11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, to be submitted to the Catstrophysical

  Multivariate Gaussian Processes to Model Stellar Activity","The radial velocity method is one of the most successful techniques for the
discovery and characterization of exoplanets. Modern spectrographs promise
measurement precision of ~0.2-0.5 m/s for an ideal target star. However, the
intrinsic variability of stellar spectra can mimic and obscure true planet
signals at these levels. Rajpaul et al. (2015) and Jones et al. (2017) proposed
applying a physically motivated, multivariate Gaussian process (GP) to jointly
model the apparent Doppler shift and multiple indicators of stellar activity as
a function of time, so as to separate the planetary signal from various forms
of stellar variability. These methods are promising, but performing the
necessary calculations can be computationally intensive and algebraically
tedious. In this work, we present a flexible and computationally efficient
software package, GPLinearOdeMaker.jl, for modeling multivariate time series
using a linear combination of univariate GPs and their derivatives. The package
allows users to easily and efficiently apply various multivariate GP models and
different covariance kernel functions. We demonstrate GPLinearOdeMaker.jl by
applying the Jones et al. (2017) model to fit measurements of the apparent
Doppler shift and activity indicators derived from simulated active solar
spectra time series affected by many evolving star spots. We show how
GPLinearOdeMaker.jl makes it easy to explore the effect of different choices
for the GP kernel. We find that local kernels could significantly increase the
sensitivity and precision of Doppler planet searches relative to the widely
used quasi-periodic kernel.","[{'name': 'Christian Gilbertson'}, {'name': 'Eric B. Ford'}, {'name': 'David E. Jones'}, {'name': 'David C.

background on the clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space
using a set of more than 1000 N-body and hydrodynamical simulations with
massless and massive neutrinos. We find that the effect neutrinos induce on the
clustering of CDM+baryons in redshift-space on small scales is almost entirely
due to the change in $\sigma_8$. Neutrinos imprint a characteristic signature
in the quadrupole of the matter (CDM+baryons+neutrinos) field on small scales,
that can be used to disentangle the effect of $\sigma_8$ and $M_\nu$. We show
that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on
all scales, to the one induced by $\sigma_8$. We find that the effects of
neutrinos of the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges from $\sim0.3\%$ to $2\%$ on
scales $k\in[0.01, 0.5]~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for neutrinos with masses $M_\nu
\leqslant 0.15$ eV. We compute the bias between the momentum of halos and the
momentum of CDM+baryon and find it to be 1 on large scales for all models with
massless and massive neutrinos considered. This point towards a velocity bias
between halos and total matter on large scales that it is important to account
for in order to extract unbiased neutrino information from velocity/momentum
surveys such as kSZ observations. We show that baryonic effects can affect the
clustering of matter and CDM+baryons in redshift-space by up to a few percent
down to $k=0.5~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical
processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect
that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and
halos in redshift-space by less than $1\%$. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in
the fully non-linear regime can be written as a transfer function with very
weak dependence on astrophysics.","[{'name': 'Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro'}, {'name': 'Arka Banerjee'}, {'name': 'Neal Dalal'}, {'name': 'Emanuele Castorina'}, {'name': 'Roman Scoccimarro'}, {'name': 'Raul Angulo'}, {'name': 'David N.

excellent agreement with recent determinations from IR surveys and, taking into
account a metallicity ceiling Z<Z_sun/2, with the estimates from long GRB
rates. They also yield a cosmic reionization history consistent with that
implied by the recent measurements of the Planck mission on the electron
scattering optical depth tau_es~0.058; remarkably, this result is obtained
under a conceivable assumption regarding the average value f_esc~0.1 of the
escape fraction for ionizing photons. We demonstrate via the abundance matching
technique that the above constraints concurrently imply galaxy formation to
become inefficient within dark matter halos of mass below a few 10^8 M_sun;
pleasingly, such a limit is also required not to run into the missing satellite
issue. Finally, we predict a downturn of the galaxy luminosity function
faintward of M_UV<-12, and stress that its detailed shape, as plausibly probed
in the next future by the JWST, will be extremely informative on the
astrophysics of galaxy formation in small halos, or even on the microscopic
nature of the dark matter.","[{'name': 'A. Lapi'}, {'name': 'Claudia Mancuso'}, {'name': 'A. Celotti'}, {'name': 'L. Danese'}]","13 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

  Characterization (PANDISC) I: Introduction to A Physically Motivated H I
  Model","Modelling the integrated H I spectra of galaxies has been a difficult task
due to their diverse shapes, but more dynamical information is waiting to be
explored in Hi line profiles. Based on simple assumptions, we construct a
physically motivated model for the integrated Hi spectra: Parametrized
Asymmetric Neutral hydrogen Disk Integrated Spectrum Characterization
(PANDISC). The model shows great flexibility in reproducing the diverse Hi
profiles. We use Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) for fitting the model to
global H I profiles, producing statistically robust quantitative results.
Comparing with several samples of H I data available in the literature , we
find the model-fitted results agree with catalogued velocity widths (e.g., W50)
down to the lowest S/N. The model is also shown to be useful for applications
like the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) and profile-based sample
control. By comparing v_r to v_flat , we uncover how the H I width is affected
by the structure of the rotation curve, following a trend consistent with the
difference in the BTFR slope. We also select a sample of spectra with broad
wing-like features suggestive of a population of galaxies with unusual gas
dynamics. The PANDISC model bears both promise and limitations for potential
use beyond H I lines. Further application on the whole ALFALFA sample will
enable us to perform large scale ensemble studies of the H I properties and
dynamics in nearby galaxies.","[{'name': 'Bo Peng'}, {'name': 'Martha P. Haynes'}, {'name': 'Catie J. Ball'}, {'name': 'Michael G.

Magellanic Cloud is the first known example of a T\.ZO, a Red Supergiant with a
degenerate neutron core. This claim is based on the star having a high
luminosity ($\log (L/L_\odot)$~> 5), an extremely cool effective temperature,
and a surface enriched in in lithium, calcium and various $irp$-process
elements. In this paper we re-examine this evidence, and present new
measurements of the stellar properties. By compiling archival photometry from
blue to mid-IR for HV~2112 and integrating under it's spectral energy
distribution we find a bolometric luminosity in the range of $\log
(L/L_\odot)$=4.70-4.91, lower than that found in previous work and comparable
to bright asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We compare a VLT+XSHOOTER
spectrum of HV~2112 to other late type, luminous SMC stars, finding no evidence
for enhancements in Rb, Ca or K, though there does seem to be an enrichment in
Li. We therefore conclude that a much more likely explanation for HV~2112 is
that it is an intermediate mass($\sim$5M$_\odot$) AGB star. However, from our
sample of comparison stars we identify a new T\.ZO candidate, HV~11417, which
seems to be enriched in Rb but for which we cannot determine a Li abundance.","[{'name': 'Emma R.

coronal loops have been extensively studied both observationally and
theoretically. Almost all driven coronal loop oscillations (e.g., by flares)
are observed to damp through time often with Gaussian or exponential profiles.
Intriguingly, however, it has been shown theoretically that the amplitudes of
some oscillations could be modified from Gaussian or exponential profiles if
cooling is present in the coronal loop systems. Indeed, in some cases the
oscillation amplitude can even increase through time. In this article, we
analyse a flare-driven coronal loop oscillation observed by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) in order to investigate
whether models of cooling can explain the amplitude profile of the oscillation
and whether hints of cooling can be found in the intensity evolution of several
SDO/AIA filters. During the oscillation of this loop system, the kink mode
amplitude appears to differ from a typical Gaussian or exponential profile with
some hints being present that the amplitude increases. The application of
cooling coronal loop modelling allowed us to estimate the density ratio between
the loop and the background plasma, with a ratio of between 2.05-2.35 being
returned. Overall, our results indicate that consideration of the thermal
evolution of coronal loop systems can allow us to better describe oscillations
in these structures and return more accurate estimates of the physical
properties of the loops (e.g., density, scale height, magnetic field strength).","[{'name': 'C. J. Nelson'}, {'name': 'A. A. Shukhobodskiy'}, {'name': 'R. Erdélyi'}, {'name': 'M. Mathioudakis'}]","7 Figures, 14 pages, Accepted for publication in Frontiers in

  mode-resampling","We present an algorithm for quickly generating multiple realizations of
N-body simulations to be used, for example, for cosmological parameter
estimation from surveys of large-scale structure. Our algorithm uses a new
method to resample the large-scale (Gaussian-distributed) Fourier modes in a
periodic N-body simulation box in a manner that properly accounts for the
nonlinear mode-coupling between large and small scales. We find that our method
for adding new large-scale mode realizations recovers the nonlinear power
spectrum to sub-percent accuracy on scales larger than about half the Nyquist
frequency of the simulation box. Using 20 N-body simulations, we obtain a power
spectrum covariance matrix estimate that matches the estimator in Takahashi et
al. (2009) (from 5000 simulations) with < 20% errors in all matrix elements.
Comparing the rates of convergence, we determine that our algorithm requires ~
8 times fewer simulations to achieve a given error tolerance in estimates of
the power spectrum covariance matrix. The degree of success of our algorithm
indicates that we understand the main physical processes that give rise to the
correlations in the matter power spectrum. Namely, the large-scale Fourier
modes modulate both the degree of structure growth through the variation in the
effective local matter density and also the spatial frequency of small-scale
perturbations through large-scale displacements. We expect our algorithm to be
useful for noise modeling when constraining cosmological parameters from weak
lensing (cosmic shear) and galaxy surveys, rescaling summary statistics of
N-body simulations for new cosmological parameter values, and any applications
where the influence of Fourier modes larger than the simulation size must be
accounted for.","[{'name': 'Michael D. Schneider'}, {'name': 'Shaun Cole'}, {'name': 'Carlos S. Frenk'}, {'name': 'Istvan Szapudi'}]","13 pages, 11 figures. Matches version accepted for publication in

of light particles in the form of dark radiation (DR) at the time of
recombination. The conventional observable of effective neutrino number,
$N_{\rm eff}$, is insufficient for probing generic, interacting models of DR.
In this work, we perform likelihood analyses which allow both free-streaming
effective neutrinos (parametrized by $N_{\rm eff}$) and interacting effective
neutrinos (parametrized by $N_{\rm fld}$). We motivate an alternative
parametrization of DR in terms of $N_{\rm tot}$ (total effective number of
neutrinos) and $f_{\rm fs}$ (the fraction of effective neutrinos which are
free-streaming), which is less degenerate than using $N_{\rm eff}$ and $N_{\rm
fld}$. Using the Planck 2015 likelihoods in conjunction with measurements of
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find constraints on the total amount of
beyond the Standard Model effective neutrinos (both free-streaming and
interacting) of $\Delta N_{\rm tot} < 0.39$ at 2$\sigma$. In addition, we
consider the possibility that this scenario alleviates the tensions between
early-time and late-time cosmological observations, in particular the
measurements of $\sigma_8$ (the amplitude of matter power fluctuations at
8$h^{-1}$ Mpc), finding a mild preference for interactions among light species.
We further forecast the sensitivities of a variety of future experiments,
including Advanced ACTPol (a representative CMB Stage-III experiment), CMB
Stage-IV, and the Euclid satellite. This study is relevant for probing
non-standard neutrino physics as well as a wide variety of new particle physics

existing cosmological probes by orders of magnitude. Many of these modes are on
smaller scales than are accessible via the CMB, and moreover have the advantage
of being firmly in the linear regime (making them easy to model theoretically).

  04191+1522. Results from the CALYPSO IRAM-PdBI survey","Context. The process of mass accretion in the earliest phases of star
formation is still not fully understood: Does the accretion rate smoothly
decline with the age of the protostar or are there short, intermittent
accretion bursts? Aims. We aim to explore whether or not the observed C$^{18}$O
and N$_2$H$^+$ emission pattern towards the VeLLO IRAM 04191+1522 can be
understood in the framework of a scenario where the emission is chemically
tracing a past accretion burst. Methods.We used high-angular-resolution Plateau
de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) observations of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ towards
IRAM 04191+1522 that were obtained as part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program.
We model these observations using a chemical code with a time-dependent
physical structure coupled with a radiative transfer module, where we allow for
variations in the source luminosity. Results. We find that the N$_2$H$^+$ line
emission shows a central hole, while the C$^{18}$O emission is compact. The
morphology of these two lines cannot be reproduced with a constant luminosity
model based on the present-day internal luminosity (0.08 L$_{sun}$). However,
the N$_2$H$^+$ peaks are consistent with a constant-luminosity model of 12
L$_{sun}$. Using a model with time-dependent temperature and density profiles,
we show that the observed N$_2$H$^+$ peak emission could indeed be caused by a
past accretion burst. Such a burst should have occurred a couple of hundred
years ago. Conclusions. We suggest that an accretion burst occurred in IRAM
04191+1522 in the recent past. If such bursts are common and sufficiently long
in VeLLOs, they could lead to higher accretion onto the central object than
their luminosity suggests. For IRAM 04191 in particular, our results yield an
estimated final mass of 0.2 - 0.25 M$_{sun}$ by the end of the Class 0 phase,
which would make this object a low-mass star rather than a brown dwarf.","[{'name': 'S. Anderl'}, {'name': 'S. Maret'}, {'name': 'S. Cabrit'}, {'name': 'A. J. Maury'}, {'name': 'A.

systems are used in order to study the global coupling of the turbulent
convection zone with the solar atmosphere where the magnetic energy is
dissipated explosively. Several well documented observations are not easy to
interpret with the use of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and/or Kinetic numerical
codes. Such observations are: (1) The size distribution of the Active Regions
(AR) on the solar surface, (2) The fractal and multi fractal characteristics of
the observed magnetograms, (3) The Self-Organised characteristics of the
explosive magnetic energy release and (4) the very efficient acceleration of
particles during the flaring periods in the solar corona. We review briefly the
work published the last twenty five years on the above issues and propose
solutions by using methods borrowed from the analysis of complex systems. The
scenario which emerged is as follows: (a) The fully developed turbulence in the
convection zone generates and transports magnetic flux tubes to the solar
surface. Using probabilistic percolation models we were able to reproduce the
size distribution and the fractal properties of the emerged and randomly moving
magnetic flux tubes. (b) Using a Non Linear Force Free (NLFF) magnetic
extrapolation numerical code we can explore how the emerged magnetic flux tubes
interact nonlinearly and form thin and Unstable Current Sheets (UCS) inside the
coronal part of the AR. (c) The fragmentation of the UCS and the redistribution
of the magnetic field locally, when the local current exceeds a Critical
threshold, is a key process which drives avalanches and forms coherent
structures. This local reorganization of the magnetic field, enhances the
energy dissipation and influences the global evolution of the complex magnetic
topology.","[{'name': 'Loukas Vlahos'}, {'name': 'Heinz Isliker'}]","23 pages, 12 Figures. Submitted to the European Physical Journal

  Analogues","Analysing all Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxies within a factor two
(+/- 0.3 dex) of the stellar mass of the Milky Way (MW), there is a 11.9%
chance that one of these galaxies will have a close companion (within a
projected separation of 70 kpc and radial separation of 400 km/s) that is at
least as massive as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Two close companions at
least as massive as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are rare at the 3.4%
level. Two full analogues to the MW- LMC-SMC system were found in GAMA (all
galaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of close
together, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4% of MW mass
galaxies (in the range where we could observe both the LMC and SMC) have such a
system. In summary, the MW-LMC-SMC system is a 2.7? event (when recast into
Gaussian statistics).
  Using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference for
SMC- LMC binary pair analogues to be located within 2 Mpc of a range of
different lumi- nosity groups. There is a particular preference is for such
binaries to be located near LG luminosity systems. When these groups are
subdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, the
binaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gap
systems. These systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer the
same amount of gravitational dark matter. This suggests that binaries such as
the SMC-LMC might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorous
merger events. Details of a particularly striking analogue to the MW-SMC-LMC

systems from SLACS, BELLS, LSD and SL2S surveys and use them to constrain the
cosmic equation of state. In particular we consider two cases of dark energy
phenomenology: $XCDM$ model where dark energy is modeled by a fluid with
constant $w$ equation of state parameter and in Chevalier - Polarski - Linder
(CPL) parametrization where $w$ is allowed to evolve with redshift: $w(z) = w_0
+ w_1 \frac{z}{1+z}$. We assume spherically symmetric mass distribution in
lensing galaxies, but relax the rigid assumption of SIS model in favor to more
general power-law index $\gamma$, also allowing it to evolve with redshifts
$\gamma(z)$. Our results for the $XCDM$ cosmology show the agreement with
values (concerning both $w$ and $\gamma$ parameters) obtained by other authors.
We go further and constrain the CPL parameters jointly with $\gamma(z)$. The
resulting confidence regions for the parameters are much better than those
obtained with a similar method in the past. They are also showing a trend of
being complementary to the supernova Ia data. Our analysis demonstrates that
strong gravitational lensing systems can be used to probe cosmological
parameters like the cosmic equation of state for dark energy. Moreover, they
have a potential to judge whether the cosmic equation of state evolved with
time or not.","[{'name': 'Shuo Cao'}, {'name': 'Marek Biesiada'}, {'name': 'Raphaël Gavazzi'}, {'name': 'Aleksandra Piórkowska'}, {'name': 'Zong-Hong Zhu'}]","7 figures, 2 tables",http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07649v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/185', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07649v1']",astro-ph.CO,['astro-ph.CO'],10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/185,"Astrophysical Journal, 806 (2015), 185"

km/s), previously thought to be separate clouds along the same line-of-sight,
are physically connected in position-velocity space via a third southern
component around 50 km/s. Further position-velocity analysis of the surrounding

physically connected to the M0.10-0.08 molecular cloud, which is suggested to

morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas in M0.20-0.033 indicate that the

velocity of 40 km/s, with a systemic velocity of 53 km/s, comparable to

empirical correlation of the mass of a black hole ($M$), its 5 GHz radio
continuum luminosity ($\nu L_{\nu}$), and its 2-10 keV X-ray power-law
continuum luminosity ($L_X$). We compile a sample of black holes with primary,
direct black hole-mass measurements that also have sensitive,
high-spatial-resolution radio and X-ray data. Taking into account a number of
systematic sources of uncertainty and their correlations with the measurements,
we use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a mass-predictor function of the
form $\log(M/10^{8}\,M_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}) = \mu_0 + \xi_{\mu R}
\log(L_R / 10^{38}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) + \xi_{\mu X} \log(L_X /

0.22$, $\xi_{\mu R} = 1.09 \pm 0.10$, and $\xi_{\mu X} = -0.59^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$
with the natural logarithm of the Gaussian intrinsic scatter in the log-mass
direction $\ln\epsilon_\mu = -0.04^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$. This result is a
significant improvement over our earlier mass scaling result because of the
increase in active galactic nuclei sample size (from 18 to 30), improvement in
our X-ray binary sample selection, better identification of Seyferts, and
improvements in our analysis that takes into account systematic uncertainties
and correlated uncertainties. Because of these significant improvements, we are
able to consider potential influences on our sample by including all sources
with compact radio and X-ray emission but ultimately conclude that the
fundamental plane can empirically describe all such sources. We end with advice
for how to use this as a tool for estimating black hole masses.","[{'name': 'Kayhan Gültekin'}, {'name': 'Ashley L. King'}, {'name': 'Edward M.

  Magnetic Fields","We present maps of the sign of the Faraday Rotation measure [sign(RM)]
obtained from multi-frequency radio observations on the Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA). Many of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) considered have B-field
structures with a central ""spine"" of B-field orthogonal to the jet and/or a
longitudinal B-field near one or both edges of the jet. This structure can
plausibly be interpreted as being caused by a helical/toroidal jet magnetic
field. Faraday Rotation is a rotation of the plane of polarization that occurs
when the polarized radiation passes through a magnetized plasma. The sign of
the RM is determined by the direction of the line-of-sight B-Field in the
region causing the Faraday Rotation, and an ordered toroidal or helical
magnetic field associated with an AGN jet will thus produce a distinctive
bilateral distribution of positive and negative RMs across the jet. We present
and discuss sign(RM) maps and their possible interpretation regarding the
magnetic field geometries for several sources.","[{'name': 'Andrea Reichstein'}, {'name': 'Denise Gabuzda'}]","From the proceedings of Beamed and Unbeamed Gamma-Rays from Galaxies,

oscillations in neutron stars due to processes that change the number of
protons, neutrons and electrons. Deviations from equilibrium of the number
densities of the various species lead to the appearance in the Euler equations
of the system of a dissipative mechanism, the so-called rocket effect. The
evolution of the r-mode oscillations of a rotating neutron star are influenced
by the rocket effect and we present estimates of the corresponding damping
timescales. In the description of the system we employ a two-fluid model, with
one fluid consisting of all the charged components locked together by the
electromagnetic interaction, while the second fluid consists of superfluid
neutrons. Both components can oscillate however the rocket effect can only
efficiently damp the countermoving r-mode oscillations, with the two fluids
oscillating out of phase. In our analysis we include the mutual friction
dissipative process between the neutron superfluid and the charged component.
We neglect the interaction between the two r-mode oscillations as well as
effects related with the crust of the star. Moreover, we use a simplified model
of neutron star assuming a uniform mass distribution.","[{'name': 'Massimo Mannarelli'}, {'name': 'Giuseppe Colucci'}, {'name': 'Cristina Manuel'}]","3 pages, 2 figure, Contribution to the proceedings of `Quark

to investigate the connection between the central X-ray source and its
surrounding environment. The hardness--intensity diagram of Cyg X-3 displays a
""shoe"" shape rather than the Q-type shape commonly seen in other black hole
X-ray binary, and exhibits no apparent hysteresis effect. During the
$\gamma$-ray outbursts, no existing data are located in the hard and
intermediate states, which suggest the absence of a significant population of
non-thermal electrons when the source is in these states. For the first time,
we present the orbital modulation of the X-ray light curve (LC) of all five
states. The different energy band LCs are in phase with each other in all five
states, and the modulation amplitude of both soft and hard X-ray LCs
monotonously increases with decreasing hardness from hard to soft non-thermal
states. We confirm that the modulation depth decreases with increasing energy
in the hard, intermediate, and very high states, as originally reported by
Zdziarski et al. However, in the soft non-thermal state, the hard X-ray
modulation strength significantly increases and is even larger than the soft
X-ray one. Our results rule out both wind absorption and jet origins of the
hard X-ray LC modulation in the soft non-thermal state, and challenge our
understanding of the states of Cyg X-3.","[{'name': 'Shan-Shan Weng'}, {'name': 'Shuang-Nan Zhang'}, {'name': 'Ming-Yu Ge'}, {'name': 'Jian Li'}, {'name': 'Shu Zhang'}]","22 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables",http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2641v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/763/1/34', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2641v1']",astro-ph.HE,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.SR']",10.1088/0004-637X/763/1/34,"2013, ApJ, 763, 34"

the wake of an eruptive X8.3 flare observed at the west limb of the Sun on
September 10, 2017. Using observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
on Hinode and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), we find that plasma in the current sheet reaches
temperatures of about 20 MK and that the range of temperatures is relatively
narrow. The highest temperatures occur at the base of the current sheet, in the
region near the top of the post-flare loop arcade. The broadest high
temperature line profiles, in contrast, occur at the largest observed heights.
Further, line broadening is strong very early in the flare and diminishes over
time. The current sheet can be observed in the AIA 211 and 171 channels, which
have a considerable contribution from thermal bremsstrahlung at flare
temperatures. Comparisons of the emission measure in these channels with other
EIS wavelengths and AIA channels dominated by Fe line emission indicate a
coronal composition and suggest that the current sheet is formed by the heating
of plasma already in the corona. Taken together, these observations suggest
that some flare heating occurs in the current sheet while additional energy is
released as newly reconnected field lines relax and become more dipolar.","[{'name': 'Harry P. Warren'}, {'name': 'David H. Brooks'}, {'name': 'Ignacio Ugarte-Urra'}, {'name': 'Jeffrey W.

  Observed with IRIS","The properties of non-statistical equilibrium ionization of silicon and
oxygen ions are analyzed in this work. We focus on four solar targets (quiet
sun, coronal hole, plage, quiescent active region, AR, and flaring AR) as
observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). IRIS is best
suited for this work due to the high cadence (up to 0.5s), high spatial
resolution (up to 0.32""), and high signal to noise ratios for O IV and Si IV.
We find that the observed intensity ratio between lines of three times ionized
silicon and oxygen ions depends on their total intensity and that this
correlation varies depending on the region observed (quiet sun, coronal holes,
plage or active regions) and on the specific observational objects present
(spicules, dynamic loops, jets, micro-flares or umbra). In order to interpret
the observations, we compare them with synthetic profiles taken from 2D
self-consistent radiative MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere, where the
statistical equilibrium or non-equilibrium treatment silicon and oxygen is
applied. These synthetic observations show vaguely similar correlations as in
the observations, i.e. between the intensity ratios and their intensities, but
only in the non-equilibrium case do we find that (some of) the observations can
be reproduced. We conclude that these lines are formed out of statistical
equilibrium. We use our time-dependent non-equilibrium ionization simulations
to describe the physical mechanisms behind these observed properties.","[{'name': 'Juan Martinez-Sykora'}, {'name': 'Bart De Pontieu'}, {'name': 'Viggo H. Hansteen'}, {'name': 'Boris V.

spectrum (PPS) from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature
anisotropy data. In our analysis we use different combinations of angular power
spectra from Planck to reconstruct the shape of the primordial power spectrum
and locate possible features. Performing an extensive error analysis we found
the dip near $\ell\sim750-850$ represents the most prominent feature in the
data. Feature near $\ell\sim1800-2000$ is detectable with high confidence only
in 217 GHz spectrum and is apparently consequence of a small systematic as
described in the revised Planck 2013 papers. Fixing the background cosmological
parameters and the foreground nuisance parameters to their best fit baseline
values, we report that the best fit power law primordial power spectrum is
consistent with the reconstructed form of the PPS at 2$\sigma$ C.L. of the
estimated errors (apart from the local features mentioned above). As a
consistency test, we found the reconstructed primordial power spectrum from
Planck temperature data can also substantially improve the fit to WMAP-9
angular power spectrum data (with respect to power-law form of the PPS)
allowing an overall amplitude shift of $\sim2.5\%$. In this context low-$\ell$
and 100 GHz spectrum from Planck which have proper overlap in the multipole
range with WMAP data found to be completely consistent with WMAP-9 (allowing
amplitude shift). As another important result of our analysis we do report the
evidence of gravitational lensing through the reconstruction analysis. Finally
we present two smooth form of the PPS containing only the important features.
These smooth forms of PPS can provide significant improvements in fitting the
data (with respect to the power law PPS) and can be helpful to give hints for
inflationary model building.","[{'name': 'Dhiraj Kumar Hazra'}, {'name': 'Arman Shafieloo'}, {'name': 'Tarun Souradeep'}]","30 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, matches published version in JCAP",http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4827v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2014/11/011', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4827v2']",astro-ph.CO,"['astro-ph.CO', 'hep-th', 'physics.data-an']",10.1088/1475-7516/2014/11/011,JCAP 11 (2014) 011

  energy supernovae from individual stars","We introduce the LYRA project, a new high resolution galaxy formation model
built within the framework of the cosmological hydro-dynamical moving mesh code
AREPO. The model resolves the multi-phase interstellar medium down to 10 K. It
forms individual stars sampled from the initial mass function (IMF), and tracks
their lifetimes and death pathways individually. Single supernova (SN) blast
waves with variable energy are followed within the hydrodynamic calculation to
interact with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In this paper, we
present the methods and apply the model to a $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ isolated halo.
We demonstrate that the majority of supernovae are Sedov-resolved at our
fiducial gas mass resolution of $4 M_{\odot}$. We show that our SN feedback
prescription self-consistently produces a hot phase within the ISM that drives
significant outflows, reduces the gas density and suppresses star formation.
Clustered SN play a major role in enhancing the effectiveness of feedback,
because the majority of explosions occur in low density material. Accounting
for variable SN energy allows the feedback to respond directly to stellar
evolution. We show that the ISM is sensitive to the spatially distributed
energy deposition. It strongly affects the outflow behaviour, reducing the mass
loading by a factor of 2-3, thus allowing the galaxy to retain a higher
fraction of mass and metals. LYRA makes it possible to use a comprehensive
multi-physics ISM model directly in cosmological (zoom) simulations of dwarf
and higher mass galaxies.","[{'name': 'Thales A.

around the NGC 3166/9 group core, which we mosaic at higher resolution using
six GMRT pointings spanning ~1 square degree. A thorough search of the GMRT
datacube reveals eight low-mass objects with gas masses ranging from 4x10^7 to
3x10^8 M_sol and total dynamical masses up to 1.4x10^9 M_sol. A comparison of
the HI fluxes measured from the GMRT data to those measured in the ALFALFA data
suggests that a significant fraction (~60%) of the HI is smoothly distributed
on scales greater than an arcminute (~7 kpc at the NGC 3166/9 distance). We
compute stellar masses and star formation rates for the eight low-mass GMRT

pre-existing dwarf irregular galaxies or short-lived, tidally formed knots;

resolved images of the supermassive black holes at the centre of our galaxy and
at the centre of the elliptical galaxy M87. As both technology and analysis

spectral index maps of both M87* and Sgr A* by applying the general

the spectral index increases with increasing magnetic field strength, electron
temperature, and optical depth. Consequently, spectral index maps grow more
negative with increasing radius in almost all models, since all of these
quantities tend to be maximised near the event horizon. Additionally, photon
ring geodesics exhibit more positive spectral indices, since they sample the
innermost regions of the accretion flow with the most extreme plasma
conditions. Spectral index maps are sensitive to highly uncertain plasma
heating prescriptions (the electron temperature and distribution function).
However, if our understanding of these aspects of plasma physics can be
tightened, even the spatially unresolved spectral index around 230 GHz can be
used to discriminate between models. In particular, Standard and Normal
Evolution (SANE) flows tend to exhibit more negative spectral indices than
Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) flows due to differences in the characteristic
magnetic field strength and temperature of emitting plasma.","[{'name': 'Angelo Ricarte'}, {'name': 'Charles Gammie'}, {'name': 'Ramesh Narayan'}, {'name': 'Ben S.

using a large suite of high-resolution cosmological FIRE-2 simulations
accounting for CR injection by supernovae. In massive ($M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim
10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$), low-redshift ($z\lesssim 1-2$) halos, which are expected
to form ""hot halos"" with slowly-cooling gas in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium
(with a stable virial shock), our simulations without CRs do exhibit clear
virial shocks. The cooler phase condensing out from inflows becomes
pressure-confined to over-dense clumps, embedded in low-density, volume-filling
hot gas whose cooling time is much longer than inflow time. The gas thus
transitions sharply from cool free-falling inflow, to hot and thermal-pressure
supported at approximately the virial radius ($\approx R_{\rm vir}$), and the
shock is quasi-spherical. With CRs, we previously argued that halos in this
particular mass and redshift range build up CR-pressure-dominated gaseous
halos. Here, we show that when CR pressure dominates over thermal pressure,
there is no significant virial shock. Instead, inflowing gas is gradually
decelerated by the CR pressure gradient and the gas is relatively subsonic out
to and even beyond $R_\mathrm{vir}$. Rapid cooling also maintains sub-virial
temperatures in the inflowing gas within $\sim R_\mathrm{vir}$.","[{'name': 'Suoqing Ji'}, {'name': 'Dušan Kereš'}, {'name': 'T. K. Chan'}, {'name': 'Jonathan Stern'}, {'name': 'Cameron B.

very-long-baseline interferometry, which represents a type of new cosmological

that the fits on CPL obtained from the quasar sample are well consistent with
those obtained from BAO. For other cosmological models considered, quasars
provide constraints in agreement with those derived with other standard probes

statistical methods including Figure of Merit, $Om(z)$ and statefinder
diagnostics indicate that: (1) Radio quasar standard ruler could provide better
statistical constraints than BAO for all cosmological models considered, which
suggests its potential to act as a powerful complementary probe to BAO and
galaxy clusters. (2) Turning to $Om(z)$ diagnostics, CPL, GCG and EDE models

  quiescent filament","In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis to mass-draining and
oscillations in a large quiescent filament prior to its successful eruption on
2015 April 28. The eruption of a smaller filament that was parallel and in
close, 350 proximity was observed to induce longitudinal oscillations and
enhance mass-draining within the filament of interest. The longitudinal
oscillation with an amplitude of 25 Mm and 23 km underwent no damping during
its observable cycle. Subsequently the slightly enhanced draining may have
excited a eruption behind the limb, leading to a feedback that further enhanced
the draining and induced simultaneous oscillations within the filament of
interest. We find significant damping for these simultaneous oscillations,
where the transverse oscillations proceeded with the amplitudes of 15 Mm and 14
km, while the longitudinal oscillations involved a larger displacement and
velocity amplitude (57 Mm, 43 km). The second grouping of oscillation lasted
for 2 cycles and had the similar period of 2 hours. From this, the curvature
radius and transverse magnetic field strength of the magnetic dips supporting
the filaments can be estimated to be 355 Mm and 34 G. The mass-draining within
the filament of interest lasted for 14 hours. The apparent velocity grew from
35 km to 85 km, with the transition being coincident with the occurrence of the
oscillations. We conclude that two filament eruptions are sympathetic, i.e. the
eruption of the quiescent filament was triggered by the eruption of the nearby
smaller filament.","[{'name': 'Jun Dai'}, {'name': 'Qingmin Zhang'}, {'name': 'Yanjie Zhang'}, {'name': 'Zhe Xu'}, {'name': 'Yingna Su'}, {'name': 'Haisheng Ji'}]",,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04695v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2d97', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04695v1']",astro-ph.SR,['astro-ph.SR'],10.3847/1538-4357/ac2d97,

0.14 eV at 95% CL. With this analysis we obtain posterior odds for normal
versus inverted ordering of about 2:1. If cosmological data is combined with
data from oscillation experiments the odds reduce to about 3:2. For an
exclusion of the inverted ordering from cosmology at more than 95% CL, an
accuracy of better than 0.02 eV is needed for the sum. We demonstrate that such

interstellar medium. Kinematical information is of particular interest since it
is a clue to the origin of the gas. Until now mostly massive galaxies have been
investigated for their halo properties. Here we report on deep HI and H{\alpha}
observations of the edge-on dwarf galaxy UGC 1281 in order to determine the
existence of extra-planar gas and the kinematics of this galaxy. This is the
first time a dwarf galaxy is investigated for its gaseous halo characteristics.
We have obtained H{\alpha} integral field spectroscopy using PPAK at Calar Alto
and deep HI observations with the WSRT of this edge-on dwarf galaxy. These
observations are compared to 3D models in order to determine the distribution
of HI in the galaxy. We find that UGC 1281 has H{\alpha} emission up to 25""(655
pc) in projection above the plane and in general a low H{\alpha} flux. Compared
to other dwarf galaxies UGC 1281 is a normal dwarf galaxy with a slowly rising
rotation curve that flattens off at 60 km/s and a central depression in its HI
distribution. Its HI extends 70"" (1.8 kpc) in projection from the plane. This
gas can be explained by either a warp partially in the line-of-sight warp or a
purely edge-on warp with rotational velocities that decline with a vertical
gradient of 10.6 \pm 3.7 km/s/kpc. The line-of-sight warp model is the
preferred model as it is conceptually simpler. In either model the warp starts
well within the optical radius.","[{'name': 'P. Kamphuis'}, {'name': 'R. F. Peletier'}, {'name': 'P. C. van der Kruit'}, {'name': 'G. H.

  Metallicity Calibrations From 47 Tuc and M55","Globular clusters are an important test bed for Newtonian gravity in the
weak-acceleration regime, which is vital to our understanding of the nature of
the gravitational interaction. Recent claims have been made that the velocity
dispersion profiles of globular clusters flatten out at large radii, despite an
apparent paucity of dark matter in such objects, indicating the need for a
modification of gravitational theories. We continue our investigation of this
claim, with the largest spectral samples ever obtained of 47 Tucanae and M55.
Furthermore, this large sample allows for an accurate metallicity calibration
based on the equivalent widths of the calcium triplet lines and K band
magnitude of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. Assuming an isothermal
distribution, the rotations of each cluster are also measured with both
clusters exhibiting clear rotation signatures. The global velocity dispersions
of NGC 121 and Kron 3, two globular clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud, are
also calculated. By applying a simple dynamical model to the velocity
dispersion profiles of 47 Tuc and M55, we calculate their mass-to-light
profiles, total masses and central velocity dispersions. We find no
statistically significant flattening of the velocity dispersion at large radii
for M55, and a marked increase in the profile of 47 Tuc for radii greater than
approximately half the tidal radius. We interpret this increase as an
evaporation signature, indicating that 47 Tuc is undergoing, or has undergone,
core-collapse, but find no requirement for dark matter or a modification of
gravitational theories in either cluster.","[{'name': 'Richard R. Lane'}, {'name': 'László L. Kiss'}, {'name': 'Geraint F. Lewis'}, {'name': 'Rodrigo A.

~ 1.9 REarth) has a size beyond this transition radius, however previous mass
measurements were not sufficiently precise to allow definite conclusions to be
drawn regarding its composition. We present new mass measurements of three of
the planets in the Kepler-20 system facilitated by 104 radial velocity
measurements from the HARPS-N spectrograph and 30 archival Keck/HIRES

Cluster Survey (NGVS) pilot field, and in the Milky Way (MW) based on
VLT/X-Shooter spectrophotometry. We find significant discrepancies in
color-color diagrams between sub-samples from different environments,
confirming that the environment has a strong influence on the integrated colors
of GCs. GC color distributions along a single color are not sufficient to
capture the differences we observe in color-color space. While the average
photometric colors become bluer with increasing radial distance to the cD
galaxy M87, we also find a relation between the environment and the slope and
intercept of the color-color relations. A denser environment seems to produce a
larger dynamic range in certain color indices. We argue that these results are
not due solely to differential extinction, IMF variations, calibration
uncertainties, or overall age/metallicity variations. We therefore suggest that
the relation between the environment and GC colors is, at least in part, due to
chemical abundance variations, which affect stellar spectra and stellar
evolution tracks. Our results demonstrate that stellar population diagnostics
derived from model predictions which are calibrated on one particular sample of
GCs may not be appropriate for all extragalactic GCs. These results advocate a
more complex model of the assembly history of GC systems in massive galaxies

High-resolution spectra were obtained with the Fibre-fed Echelle Spectrograph

analysed with a differential model atmosphere method. Comparison stars were
observed and analysed with the same method. The average value of [Fe/H] for the

separated into three age subgroups. Along with the main 8- and 12-Gyr-old
populations, a subgroup of stars younger than 5 Gyr can be separated as well.
Abundances of oxygen, alpha-elements, and r-process dominated elements are
higher than in Galactic thin-disc dwarfs. This elemental abundance pattern has
similar characteristics to that of the Galactic thick disc and differs slightly
from those in Hercules, Arcturus, and AF06 stellar streams. The similar
chemical composition of stars in Group 1, as well as in Group 2 and 3, with
that in stars of the thick disc might suggest that their formation histories

pairs. In such a charge-starved BH magnetosphere, the force-free condition
breaks down in the polar funnels. Applying the pulsar outer-magnetospheric
lepton accelerator theory to super-massive BHs, we demonstrate that a strong
electric field arises along the magnetic field lines in the direct vicinity of
the event horizon in the funnels, that the electrons and positrons are
accelerated up to 100~TeV in this vacuum gap, and that these leptons emit
copious photons via inverse-Compton (IC) process between 0.1~TeV and 30~TeV for

fluxes are beamed in a relatively small solid angle around the rotation axis

field, and show an anti-correlation with the RIAF submillimeter fluxes. The gap
luminosity little depends on the three-dimensional magnetic-field

  their Nucleosynthesis Sites","Various nucleosynthesis studies have pointed out that the r-process elements
in very metal-poor (VMP) halo stars might have different origins. By means of
familiar concepts from statistics (correlations, cluster analysis, rank tests
of elemental abundances), we look for causally correlated elemental abundance
patterns and attempt to link them to astrophysical events. Some of these events
produce the r-process elements jointly with iron, while others do not have any
significant iron contribution. In the early stage of our Galaxy, at least three
r-process nucleosynthesis sites have been active. The first two produce and
eject iron and the majority of the lighter r-process elements. We assign them
to two different types of core-collapse events, not identical to regular
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which produce only light trans-Fe elements.
The third category is characterized by a strong r-process and responsible for
the major fraction of the heavy main r-process elements without a significant
co-production of Fe. It does not appear to be connected to CCSNe, in fact the
Fe found in the related r-process enriched stars must come from previously
occurring CCSNe. The existence of actinide boost stars indicates a further
division among strong r-process sites. We assign these two strong r-process
sites to neutron star mergers without fast black hole formation and to events
where the ejecta are dominated by black hole accretion disk outflows.
Indications from the lowest-metallicity stars hint at a connection to massive
single stars (collapsars) forming black holes in the early Galaxy.","[{'name': 'Khalil Farouqi'}, {'name': 'Friedrich-Karl Thielemann'}, {'name': 'Stephan Rosswog'}, {'name': 'Karl-Ludwig Kratz'}]","40 pages, 25 figures, 10 tables",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03486v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202141038', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03486v1']",astro-ph.SR,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.GA']",10.1051/0004-6361/202141038,"A&A 663, A70 (2022)"

  relation, baryonic mass-velocity relation, velocity function and clustering","It has long been regarded as difficult for a cosmological model to account
simultaneously for the galaxy luminosity, mass, and velocity distributions. We
revisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along with
the best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter. We find
that the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundance
matching (HAM) and simple dynamical corrections, fits all basic statistics of
galaxies with circular velocities Vcirc > 80 km/s. Our observational constraint
is the luminosity-velocity relation which allows all types of galaxies to be
included. We have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarf
irregulars to giant ellipticals. The data present a clear monotonic
luminosity-velocity relation from 50 km/s to 500 km/s, with a bend below 80
km/s and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. For
comparison to theory, we employ our LCDM ""Bolshoi"" simulation of dark matter,
which has unprecedented mass and force resolution. We use halo abundance
matching to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the dark matter halos.
The resulting predictions for the luminosity-velocity relation are in excellent
agreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies for
the luminosity range from Mr = -14-22. We also compare our predictions for the
""cold"" baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function of
circular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very good
agreement. The predicted circular velocity function is in agreement with the
galaxy velocity function for 80-400 km/s. However, we find that the dark matter
halos with Vcirc < 80 km/s are much more abundant than observed galaxies with
the same Vcirc . We find that the two-point correlation function of galaxies in
our model matches very well the results from the SDSS.","[{'name': 'Sebastian Trujillo-Gomez'}, {'name': 'Anatoly Klypin'}, {'name': 'Joel Primack'}, {'name': 'Aaron J.

  Its Imaged Companions","HR 8799 is an hF0 mA5 gamma Doradus, lambda Bootis, Vega-type star best known
for hosting four directly imaged candidate planetary companions. Using the
CHARA Array interferometer, we measure HR 8799's limb-darkened angular diameter
to be 0.342 +/- 0.008 mas; this is the smallest interferometrically measured
stellar diameter to date, with an error of only 2%. By combining our
measurement with the star's parallax and photometry from the literature, we
greatly improve upon previous estimates of its fundamental parameters,
including stellar radius (1.44 +/- 0.06 R_Sun), effective temperature (7193 +/-
87 K, consistent with F0), luminosity (5.05 +/- 0.29 L_Sun), and the extent of
the habitable zone (1.62 AU to 3.32 AU). These improved stellar properties
permit much more precise comparisons with stellar evolutionary models, from
which a mass and age can be determined, once the metallicity of the star is
known. Considering the observational properties of other lambda Bootis stars
and the indirect evidence for youth of HR 8799, we argue that the internal
abundance, and what we refer to as the effective abundance, is most likely
near-solar. Finally, using the Yonsei-Yale evolutionary models with uniformly
scaled solar-like abundances, we estimate HR 8799's mass and age considering
two possibilities: 1.516 +0.038/-0.024 M_Sun and 33 +7/-13 Myr if the star is
contracting toward the zero age main-sequence or 1.513 +0.023/-0.024 M_Sun and
90 +381/-50 Myr if it is expanding from it. This improved estimate of HR 8799's
age with realistic uncertainties provides the best constraints to date on the
masses of its orbiting companions, and strongly suggests they are indeed
planets. They nevertheless all appear to orbit well outside the habitable zone
of this young star.","[{'name': 'Ellyn K. Baines'}, {'name': 'Russel J. White'}, {'name': 'Daniel Huber'}, {'name': 'Jeremy Jones'}, {'name': 'Tabetha Boyajian'}, {'name': 'Harold A.

  Radius in Low-z Quasars","Black Hole Mass (M_BH) estimation in quasars, especially at high redshift,
involves use of single epoch spectra with s/n and resolution that permit
accurate measurement of the width of a broad line assumed to be a reliable
virial estimator. Coupled with an estimate of the radius of the broad line
region this yields M_BH. The radius of the broad line region (BLR) may be
inferred from an extrapolation of the correlation between source luminosity and
reverberation derived r_BLR measures (the so-called Kaspi relation involving
about 60 low z sources). We are exploring a different method for estimating
r_BLR directly from inferred physical conditions in the BLR of each source. We
report here on a comparison of r_BLR estimates that come from our method and
from reverberation mapping. Our ""photoionization"" method employs diagnostic
line intensity ratios in the rest-frame range 1400-2000 A
(AlIII1860/SiIII]1892, CIV1549/AlIII1860) that enable derivation of the product
of density and ionization parameter with the BLR distance derived from the
definition of the ionization parameter. We find good agreement between our
estimates of the density, ionization parameter and r_BLR and those from
reverberation mapping. We suggest empirical corrections to improve the
agreement between individual photoionization-derived r_BLR values and those
obtained from reverberation mapping. The results in this paper can be exploited
to estimate M_BH for large samples of high-z quasars using an appropriate
virial broadening estimator. We show that the width of the UV intermediate
emission lines are consistent with the width of H beta, therefore providing a
reliable virial broadening estimator that can be measured in large samples of
high-z quasars.","[{'name': 'C. Alenka Negrete'}, {'name': 'Deborah Dultzin'}, {'name': 'Paola Marziani'}, {'name': 'Jack w.

time disperses due to photoevaporation, accretion, and possibly planet
formation. The accretion shock on the central star produces an UV/optical
veiling continuum, line emission, and X-ray signatures. As the accretion rate
decreases, the impact on the central star must change. In this article we study
MN Lup, a young star where no indications of a disk are seen in IR
observations. We present XMM-Newton and VLT/UVES observations, some of them
taken simultaneously. The X-ray data show that MN Lup is an active star with
L_X/L_bol close to the saturation limit. However, we find high densities (n_e >
3e10 /cm^3) in the X-ray grating spectrum. This can be well fitted using an
accretion shock model with an accretion rate of 2e-11 M_sun/yr. Despite the
simple Halpha line profile which has a broad component, but no absorption
signatures as typically seen on accreting TTS, we find rotational modulation in
Ca II K and in photospheric absorption lines. In the Halpha line we see a
prominence in absorption about 2R_* above the stellar surface - the first of
its kind on a TTS. MN Lup is also the only TTS where accretion is seen, but no
dust disk is detected that could fuel it. We suggest that MN Lup presents a
unique and short-lived state in the disk evolution. It may have lost its dust
disk only recently and is now accreting the remaining gas at a very low rate.","[{'name': 'H. M. Guenther'}, {'name': 'U. Wolter'}, {'name': 'J. Robrade'}, {'name': 'S. J.

of starlight are arranged in a non-redundant pattern at the entrance of the
combiner so that the signal from each baseline can be separated from one

overlap in the frequency domain, this can give rise to a systematic error in
the fringe measurements known as baseline crosstalk. In this paper we quantify
crosstalk arising from the combination of atmospheric seeing and beam
propagation over distances of order hundreds of metres. We find that in
idealised conditions atmospheric wavefront errors and beam propagation do not
contribute to crosstalk. However, when aperture stops are included in the
optical beam train we observe that wavefront errors can result in squared
visibility errors arising from crosstalk as high as $\Delta V^{2} =

that obscured AGN host galaxies are more compact than non-AGN star-forming

obscured accretion phase may be related to galaxies experiencing a compaction
of their gaseous component, which could be associated with enhanced central
star formation before a subsequent quenching driving the formation of compact
passive galaxies. Moreover, most of the detected and stacked rest-frame FIR
sizes of AGNs in our sample are similar or more compact than their rest-frame
optical sizes, which is consistent with recent results of ALMA detected

place in the compact regions, and suggests that the star formation mechanisms
in the compact regions of AGN hosts are similar to those observed in
star-forming galaxies observed with ALMA.","[{'name': 'Yu-Yen Chang'}, {'name': ""Emeric Le Floc'h""}, {'name': 'Stéphanie Juneau'}, {'name': 'Elisabete da Cunha'}, {'name': 'Mara Salvato'}, {'name': 'Avishai Dekel'}, {'name': 'Francesca Civano'}, {'name': 'Stefano Marchesi'}, {'name': 'Hyewon Suh'}, {'name': 'Wei-Hao Wang'}]",accepted for publication in ApJ,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07858v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab595b', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07858v1']",astro-ph.GA,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.CO']",10.3847/1538-4357/ab595b,

($M_\star \gtrsim 10^{11} \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) at redshifts $z \sim 0.2$ to $z

relation $M_\mathrm{dyn} \equiv K \ \sigma_\mathrm{e}^2 r_\mathrm{e} / G$ with
$K = 5.0$; this assumes homology between our galaxies and nearby massive
ellipticals. Our sample is completed using literature data, including
individual objects up to $z \sim 2.5$ and a large local reference sample from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that, at all redshifts, the
discrepancy between $M_\star$ and $M_\mathrm{dyn}$ grows as galaxies depart
from the present-day relation between stellar mass and size: the more compact a
galaxy, the larger its $M_\star / M_\mathrm{dyn}$. Current uncertainties in
stellar masses cannot account for values of $M_\star / M_\mathrm{dyn}$ above 1.

planet formation. Yet key questions remain. In this review we first address the
growth of 100 km-scale planetesimals as a consequence of dust coagulation and
concentration, with current models favoring the streaming instability.
Planetesimals grow into Mars-sized (or larger) planetary embryos by a
combination of pebble- and planetesimal accretion. Models for the final
assembly of the inner Solar System must match constraints related to the
terrestrial planets and asteroids including their orbital and compositional
distributions and inferred growth timescales. Two current models -- the
Grand-Tack and low-mass (or empty) primordial asteroid belt scenarios -- can
each match the empirical constraints but both have key uncertainties that
require further study. We present formation models for close-in super-Earths --
the closest current analogs to our own terrestrial planets despite their very
different formation histories -- and for terrestrial exoplanets in gas giant
systems. We explain why super-Earth systems cannot form in-situ but rather may
be the result of inward gas-driven migration followed by the disruption of
compact resonant chains. The Solar System is unlikely to have harbored an early
system of super-Earths; rather, Jupiter's early formation may have blocked the
ice giants' inward migration. Finally, we present a chain of events that may
explain why our Solar System looks different than more than 99\% of exoplanet
systems.","[{'name': 'Andre Izidoro'}, {'name': 'Sean N. Raymond'}]","Review to appear as a chapter in the ""Handbook of Exoplanets"", ed. H.

lack the baryonic physics that is crucial to determine the observed properties
of clusters. One solution is to use (semi-)analytical models to implement the
needed baryonic physics. In this way, we can generate the many mock universes
that will be required to fully exploit future large sky surveys, such as that
from the upcoming eROSITA X-ray telescope. We developed a phenomenological
model based on observations of clusters to implement gas density and
temperature information on the dark-matter-only halos of the MultiDark
simulations. We generate several full-sky mock light-cones of clusters for the
WMAP and Planck cosmologies, adopting different parameters in our
phenomenological model of the intra-cluster medium. For one of these
simulations and models, we also generate 100 light-cones corresponding to 100

this first paper on MultiDark mock galaxy cluster light-cones, we focus on
presenting our methodology and discuss predictions for eROSITA, in particular,

formation, mergers, and tidal destruction, and an observed conditional
luminosity function Phi(L|M), to study the origin and evolution of galactic and
extragalactic light inside a cosmological volume of size (100 Mpc)^3, in a
concordance LCDM model. This algorithm simulates the growth of large-scale
structures and the formation of clusters, the evolution of the galaxy
population in clusters, the destruction of galaxies by mergers and tides, and
the evolution of the intracluster light. We find that destruction of galaxies
by mergers dominates over destruction by tides by about an order of magnitude
at all redshifts. However, tidal destruction is sufficient to produce
intracluster light fractions f_ICL that are sufficiently high to match
observations. The bulk of the intracluster light (60%) is provided by
intermediate galaxies of total masses 10^11 Msun-10^12 Msun and stellar masses
6x10^8 Msun-3x10^10 Msun that were tidally destroyed by even more massive
galaxies. The contribution of low-mass galaxies to the intracluster light is
small and the contribution of dwarf galaxies is negligible, even though, by
numbers, most galaxies that are tidally destroyed are dwarfs. Tracking clusters
back in time, we find that their values of f_ICL tend to increase over time,
but can experience sudden changes that are sometimes non-monotonic. These
changes occur during major mergers involving clusters of comparable masses but
very different intracluster luminosities. Most of the tidal destruction events
take place in the central regions of clusters. As a result, the intracluster
light is more centrally concentrated than the galactic light. Our results
support tidal destruction of intermediate-mass galaxies as a plausible scenario
for the origin of the intracluster light.","[{'name': 'Hugo Martel'}, {'name': 'Paramita Barai'}, {'name': 'William Brito'}]","13 figures, one in color.

  feedback from active galactic nuclei: method and tests","(Abridged) We present a method that tracks the growth of supermassive black
holes (BHs) and the feedback from AGN in cosmological simulations. Our model is
a substantially modified version of the one by Springel et al. (2005). Because
cosmological simulations lack both the resolution and the physics to model the
multiphase interstellar medium, they tend to strongly underestimate the
Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate. To allow low-mass BHs to grow, it is therefore
necessary to increase the predicted Bondi-Hoyle rates in dense gas by large,
ad-hoc factors. We explore the physical regimes where the use of such factors
is reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for gas accretion.
Feedback from AGN is modeled by coupling a fraction of the rest-mass energy of
the accreted gas thermally into the surrounding medium. We describe the
implementation as well as the limitations of the model and motivate all the
changes relative to previous work.
  We investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star
formation history, the redshift zero cosmic BH density, BH scaling relations,
and galaxy specific star formation rates. We find that the freedom introduced
by the need to increase the predicted accretion rates, the standard procedure
in the literature, is the most significant source of uncertainty. Our
simulations demonstrate that supermassive BHs are able to regulate their growth
by releasing a fixed amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the
assumed efficiency of AGN feedback, which sets the normalization of the BH
scaling relations. Regardless of whether BH seeds are initially placed above or
below the BH scaling relations they grow onto the same relations. AGN feedback
efficiently suppresses star formation in high-mass galaxies.","[{'name': 'C. M. Booth'}, {'name': 'Joop Schaye'}]","24 pages, 9 figures.

distributions of dust surface density, temperature, and grain size, we
conducted a multi-band analysis with several dust models, incorporating ALMA
archival data of the 0.87 mm and 3.1 mm dust polarization. The results showed
that the Toomre $Q$ parameter is $\lesssim2$ at a 20 au radius, assuming a
dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01. This implies that a higher dust-to-gas mass
ratio is necessary to stabilize the disk. The grain sizes depend on the dust
models, and for the DSHARP compact dust, they were found to be smaller than
$\sim400$ $\mu$m in the inner region ($r\lesssim20$ au), while exceeding larger
than 3 mm in the outer part. Radiative transfer calculations show that the dust
scale height is lower than at least one-third of the gas scale height. These
distributions of dust enrichment, grain sizes, and weak turbulence strength may
have significant implications for the formation of planetesimals through
mechanisms such as streaming instability. We also discuss the CO snowline
effect and collisional fragmentation in dust coagulation for the origin of the
dust size distribution.","[{'name': 'Satoshi Ohashi'}, {'name': 'Munetake Momose'}, {'name': 'Akimasa Kataoka'}, {'name': 'Aya E Higuchi'}, {'name': 'Takashi Tsukagoshi'}, {'name': 'Takahiro Ueda'}, {'name': 'Claudio Codella'}, {'name': 'Linda Podio'}, {'name': 'Tomoyuki Hanawa'}, {'name': 'Nami Sakai'}, {'name': 'Hiroshi Kobayashi'}, {'name': 'Satoshi Okuzumi'}, {'name': 'Hidekazu Tanaka'}]","29 pages, 21 figures, 5 tables.

  correlations between planetary orbital properties and stellar ages","Many exoplanets have orbital characteristics quite different from those seen
in our own solar system, including planets locked in orbital resonances and
planets on orbits that are elliptical or highly inclined from their host star's
spin axis. It is debated whether the wide variety in system architecture is
primarily due to differences in formation conditions (nature) or due to
evolution over time (nurture). Identifying trends between planetary and stellar
properties, including stellar age, can help distinguish between these competing
theories and offer insights as to how planets form and evolve. However, it can
be challenging to determine whether observed trends between planetary
properties and stellar age are driven by the age of the system -- pointing to
evolution over time being an important factor -- or other parameters to which
the age may be related, such as stellar mass or stellar temperature. The
situation is complicated further by the possibilities of selection biases,
small number statistics, uncertainties in stellar age, and orbital evolution
timescales that are typically much shorter than the range of observed ages.
Here we develop a Bayesian statistical framework to assess the robustness of
such observed correlations and to determine whether they are indeed due to
evolutionary processes, are more likely to reflect different formation
scenarios, or are merely coincidental. We apply this framework to reported
trends between stellar age and 2:1 orbital resonances, spin-orbit
misalignments, and hot Jupiters' orbital eccentricities. We find strong support
for the nurture hypothesis only in the final case.","[{'name': 'Emily D. Safsten'}, {'name': 'Rebekah I.

  Super-Massive Black Holes","Whereas considerable effort has been afforded in understanding the properties
of galaxies, a full physical picture, connecting their baryonic and dark-matter
content, super-massive black holes, and (metric) theories of gravity, is still
ill-defined. Strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probe
gravity in the central regions of galaxies. It can (1) provide a unique
detection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,
(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detection
experiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe central
super-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxy
formation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of the
nature and state of dark matter. To seriously address the above questions, a
considerable increase in the number of strong gravitational-lens systems is
required. In the timeframe 2010-2020, a staged approach with radio (e.g. EVLA,
e-MERLIN, LOFAR, SKA phase-I) and optical (e.g. LSST and JDEM) instruments can
provide 10^(2-4) new lenses, and up to 10^(4-6) new lens systems from
SKA/LSST/JDEM all-sky surveys around ~2020. Follow-up imaging of (radio) lenses
is necessary with moderate ground/space-based optical-IR telescopes and with
30-50m telescopes for spectroscopy (e.g. TMT, GMT, ELT). To answer these
fundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investment
in large radio and optical-IR facilities is therefore critical in the coming
decade. In particular, only large-scale radio lens surveys (e.g. with SKA)
provide the large numbers of high-resolution and high-fidelity images of lenses
needed for SMBH and flux-ratio anomaly studies.","[{'name': 'L. V. E. Koopmans', 'affiliation': 'Kapteyn Astronomical Institute'}, {'name': 'M. Auger', 'affiliation': 'UCSB'}, {'name': 'M.

  Near-Surface Water-Equivalent Hydrogen on Mars","We present improved Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer (MONS) maps of
near-surface Water-Equivalent Hydrogen (WEH) on Mars that have intriguing
implications for the global distribution of ""excess"" ice, which occurs when the
mass fraction of water ice exceeds the threshold amount needed to saturate the
pore volume in normal soils. We have refined the crossover technique of Feldman
et al. (2011) by using spatial deconvolution and Gaussian weighting to create
the first globally self-consistent map of WEH. At low latitudes, our new maps
indicate that WEH exceeds 15% in several near-equatorial regions, such as
Arabia Terra, which has important implications for the types of hydrated
minerals present at low latitudes. At high latitudes, we demonstrate that the
disparate MONS and Phoenix Robotic Arm (RA) observations of near surface WEH
can be reconciled by a three-layer model incorporating dry soil over fully
saturated pore ice over pure excess ice: such a three-layer model can also
potentially explain the strong anticorrelation of subsurface ice content and
ice table depth observed at high latitudes. At moderate latitudes, we show that
the distribution of recently formed impact craters is also consistent with our
latest MONS results, as both the shallowest ice-exposing crater and deepest
non-ice-exposing crater at each impact site are in good agreement with our
predictions of near-surface WEH. Overall, we find that our new mapping is
consistent with the widespread presence at mid-to-high Martian latitudes of
recently deposited shallow excess ice reservoirs that are not yet in
equilibrium with the atmosphere.","[{'name': 'Asmin V. Pathare'}, {'name': 'William C. Feldman'}, {'name': 'Thomas H.

background noise. For the first time, we propose the use of this method for the
detection of sources in gamma-ray astrophysical images obtained from the
Fermi-LAT data, where each point corresponds to the arrival direction of a
photon. We investigate the detection performance of the gamma-ray DBSCAN in
terms of detection efficiency and rejection of spurious clusters, using a
parametric approach, and exploring a large volume of the gamma-ray DBSCAN
parameter space. By means of simulated data we statistically characterize the
gamma-ray DBSCAN, finding signatures that differentiate purely random fields,
from fields with sources. We define a significance level for the detected
clusters, and we successfully test this significance with our simulated data.
We apply the method to real data, and we find an excellent agreement with the
results obtained with simulated data. We find that the gamma-ray DBSCAN can be
successfully used in the detection of clusters in gamma-ray data. The
significance returned by our algorithm is strongly correlated with that
provided by the Maximum Likelihood analysis with standard Fermi-LAT software,
and can be used to safely remove spurious clusters. The positional accuracy of
the reconstructed cluster centroid compares to that returned by standard
Maximum Likelihood analysis, allowing to look for astrophysical counterparts in
narrow regions, minimizing the chance probability in the counterpart
association. We find that gamma-ray DBSCAN is a powerful tool in the detection
of clusters in gamma-ray data, this method can be used both to look for
point-like sources, and extended sources, and can be potentially applied to any
astrophysical field related with detection of clusters in data.","[{'name': 'A. Tramacere', 'affiliation': 'ISDC, Data Centre for Astrophysics, Versoix, Switzerland'}, {'name': 'C.

  Alfvenic drift","We explore how wave-particle interactions affect diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) at astrophysical shocks by performing time-dependent kinetic simulations,
in which phenomenological models for magnetic field amplification (MFA),
Alfvenic drift, thermal leakage injection, Bohm-like diffusion, and a free
escape boundary are implemented. If the injection fraction of cosmic-ray (CR)
particles is greater than 2x10^{-4}, for the shock parameters relevant for
young supernova remnants, DSA is efficient enough to develop a significant
shock precursor due to CR feedback, and magnetic field can be amplified up to a
factor of 20 via CR streaming instability in the upstream region. If scattering
centers drift with Alfven speed in the amplified magnetic field, the CR energy
spectrum can be steepened significantly and the acceleration efficiency is
reduced. Nonlinear DSA with self-consistent MFA and Alfvenic drift predicts
that the postshock CR pressure saturates roughly at 10 % of the shock ram
pressure for strong shocks with a sonic Mach number ranging 20< M_s< 100. Since
the amplified magnetic field follows the flow modification in the precursor,
the low energy end of the particle spectrum is softened much more than the high
energy end. As a result, the concave curvature in the energy spectra does not
disappear entirely even with the help of Alfvenic drift. For shocks with a
moderate Alfven Mach number (M_A<10), the accelerated CR spectrum can become as
steep as E^{-2.1}-E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR
spectrum and gamma-ray photon spectrum of several young supernova remnants.","{'name': 'Hyesung Kang', 'affiliation': 'Pusan National University, Pusan, Korea'}","12 pages with 6 figures To appear in October 2012 issue of Journal of

as a threat to planet formation, as it removes solid material from the disk
before it can be assembled into planets. However, it may also concentrate
solids at particular locations in the disk, thus accelerating the coagulation
process. Planetesimals are thought to drift much faster in an eccentric disk,
due to their higher velocities with respect to the gas, but their drift rate
has only been calculated using approximate means. In this work, we show that in
some cases, previous estimates of the drift rate, based on a modification of
the results for an axisymmetric disk, are highly inaccurate. In particular, we
find that under some easily realized circumstances, planetesimals may drift
outwards, rather than inwards. This results in the existence of radii in the
disk that act as stable attractors of planetesimals. We show that this can lead
to a local enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the surface
density of planetesimals, even when a wide dispersion of planetesimal size is
considered.",{'name': 'Kedron Silsbee'},Accepted for publication in ApJ,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00160v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00160v1,astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],,

between the OIII/X-ray luminosity depicting the accretion power, the radio
luminosity as a probe of the instantaneous jet power and the mass of the black
hole. For the first time, we use the 1.4 GHz FIRST radio luminosities on the
optical fundamental plane, to investigate whether or not FIRST fluxes can trace
nuclear activity. We use a SDSS-FIRST cross-correlated sample of 10149 active
galaxies and analyse their positioning on the optical fundamental plane. We
focus on various reasons that can cause the discrepancy between the observed
FIRST radio fluxes and the theoretically expected core radio fluxes, and show
that that FIRST fluxes are heavily contaminated by non-nuclear, extended
components and other environmental factors. We show that the subsample of
'compact sources', which should have negligible lobe contribution,
statistically follow the fundamental plane when corrected for relativistic
beaming, while all the other sources lie above the plane. The sample of LINERs,
which should have negligible lobe and beaming contribution, also follow the
fundamental plane. A combined fit of the low-luminosity AGN and the X-ray
binaries, with the LINERs, results in the relation log L$_R$ = 0.77 log
L$_{OIII}$ + 0.69 log M. Assuming that the original fundamental plane relation
is correct, we conclude that 1.4 GHz FIRST fluxes do not trace the pure 'core'

dynamic behaviour of galaxies was initially ascribed to a modification of

composed by collisionless Vlasov particles with a primordial typical velocity
$\simeq 330$ km s$^{-1}$ and, consequently, they evaporated from galactic cores
and reorganized in halos with a cusp at a finite distance from the galactic
center (in contrast with Cold Dark Matter simulations which predict a cusp at
the center of galaxies). This is confirmed by mean-field N-body simulations of
the self-gravitating Vlasov dark matter particles in the potential well of the
baryonic core. The rest mass of these particles, $\mu$, is determined from a
kinetic theory of the early universe with a cosmological constant. We find that

baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB)
experiments to constrain phenomenological interacting dark energy models using
the Fisher matrix formalism. We consider a Euclid-like experiment, in which BAO
measurements is one of the main goals, to constrain the cosmological parameters
of alternative cosmological models. Moreover, additional experimental probes
can more efficiently provide information on the parameters forecast, justifying
also the inclusion in the analysis of a future ground-based CMB experiment
mainly designed to measure the polarization signal with high precision. In the
interacting dark energy scenario, a coupling between dark matter and dark
energy modifies the conservation equations such that the fluid equations for
both constituents are conserved as the total energy density of the dark sector.
In this context, we consider three phenomenological models which have been
deeply investigated in literature over the past years. We find that the
combination of both CMB and BAO information can break degeneracies among the
dark sector parameters for all three models, although to different extents. We
found powerful constraints on, for example, the coupling constant when
comparing it with present limits for two of the models, and their future
statistical 3-$\sigma$ bounds could potentially exclude the null interaction
for the combination of probes that is considered. However, for one of the
models, the constraint on the coupling parameter does not improve the present
result (achieved using a large combination of surveys), and a larger
combination of probes appears to be necessary to eventually claim whether or
not interaction is favored in that context.","[{'name': 'Larissa Santos'}, {'name': 'Wen Zhao'}, {'name': 'Elisa G. M. Ferreira'}, {'name': 'Jerome Quintin'}]","15 pages, 10 figures.

  to SPICA","Infrared (IR) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic star
formation history and AGN evolution, since their most intense stages are often
obscured by dust. Japanese infrared satellite, AKARI, provided unique data sets
to probe these both at low and high redshifts. The AKARI performed an all sky
survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160$\mu$m) with 3-10 times better
sensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak
of the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can
measure the total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies much
more precisely, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density of the local
Universe. In the AKARI NEP deep field, we construct restframe 8$\mu$m,
12$\mu$m, and total infrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2
using 4128 infrared sources. A continuous filter coverage in the mid-IR
wavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 24$\mu$m) by the AKARI
satellite allows us to estimate restframe 8$\mu$m and 12$\mu$m luminosities
without using a large extrapolation based on a SED fit, which was the largest
uncertainty in previous work. By combining these two results, we reveal
dust-hidden cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution from $z$=0 to
$z$=2.2, all probed by the AKARI satellite. The next generation space infrared
telescope, SPICA, will revolutionize our view of the infrared Universe with
superb sensitivity of the cooled 3m space telescope. We conclude with our
survey proposal and future prospects with SPICA.","[{'name': 'Tomotsugu Goto', 'affiliation': 'NTHU'}, {'name': 'Takehiko Wada', 'affiliation': 'ISAS/JAXA'}, {'name': 'Hideo Matsuhara', 'affiliation': 'ISAS/JAXA'}, {'name': 'the AKARI NEP team'}, {'name': 'the AKARI all sky survey team'}, {'name': 'the SPICA MCS team'}]","Proceedings of the ""SPICA's New Window on the Cool Universe""

  lunar coplanar perturbation on Galileo satellites","Motivated by the practical interest in the third-body perturbation as a
natural cleaning mechanism for high-altitude Earth orbits, we investigate the
dynamics stemming from the secular Hamiltonian associated with the lunar
perturbation, assuming that the Moon lies on the ecliptic plane. The secular
Hamiltonian defined in that way is characterized by two timescales. We compare
the location and stability of the fixed points associated with the secular
Hamiltonian averaged with respect to the fast variable with the corresponding
periodic orbits of the full system. Focusing on the orbit of the Galileo
satellites, it turns out that the two dynamics cannot be confused, as the
relative difference depends on the ratio between the semi-major axis of Galileo
and the one of the Moon, that is not negligible.
  The result is relevant to construct rigorously the Arnold diffusion mechanism

  Spectra and SED Modeling","We present modeling and interpretation of the continuum and emission lines
for a sample of 51 unobscured Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). All of these
AGNs have high quality spectra from both XMM-Newton and Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). We extend the wavelength coverage where possible by adding
simultaneous UV data from the OM onboard XMM-Newton. Our sample is selected
based on low reddening in the optical and low gas columns implied by their
X-ray spectra. They also lack clear signatures for the presence of a warm
absorber. Therefore the observed characteristics of this sample are likely to
be directly related to the intrinsic properties of the central engine.
  We perform multi-component spectral fitting for strong optical emission lines
and the whole optical spectra. We fit the combined optical, UV and X-ray data
by applying a new broadband SED model which comprises the accretion disc
emission, low temperature optically thick Comptonisation and a hard X-ray tail
by introducing the a corona radius (Done et al. 2011). We find that in order to
fit the data, the model often requires an additional long wavelength optical
continuum component, whose origin is discussed in this paper. We also find that
the Photo-recombination edge of Balmer continuum shifts and broadens beyond the
standard limit of 3646{\AA}, implying an electron number density which is far
higher than that in the broad line region clouds.
  Our results indicate that the Narrow Line Seyfert 1s in this sample tend to
have lower black hole masses, higher Eddington ratios, softer 2-10 keV band
spectra, lower 2-10 keV luminosities and higher \alpha_{ox}, compared with
typical broad line Seyfert 1s (BLS1), although their bolometric luminosities
are similar. We illustrate these differences in properties by forming an
average SED for three subsamples, based on the FWHM velocity width of the
H{\beta} emission line.","[{'name': 'C. Jin'}, {'name': 'M. Ward'}, {'name': 'C. Done'}, {'name': 'J. M.

galaxies, NGC 520, NGC 2623, and NGC 3256, using BVI imaging taken with the
Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The tidal
tails in all three systems contain compact and fairly massive young star
clusters, embedded in a sea of diffuse, unresolved stellar light. We compare
the measured colors and luminosities with predictions from population synthesis
models to estimate cluster ages and find that clusters began forming in tidal
tails during or shortly after the formation of the tails themselves. We find a
lack of very young clusters ($\le 10$ Myr old), implying that eventually star
formation shuts off in the tails as the gas is used up or dispersed. There are
a few clusters in each tail with estimated ages that are older than the modeled
tails themselves, suggesting that these may have been stripped out from the
original galaxy disks. The luminosity function of the tail clusters can be
described by a single power-law, $dN/dL \propto L^\alpha$, with $-2.6 < \alpha
< -2.0$. We find a stellar age gradient across some of the tidal tails, which
we interpret as a superposition of 1) newly formed stars and clusters along the
dense center of the tail and 2) a sea of broadly distributed, older stellar
material ejected from the progenitor galaxies.","[{'name': 'A. J. Mulia'}, {'name': 'R. Chandar'}, {'name': 'B. C. Whitmore'}]","13 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ. Image quality

occurs. This non-thermal radio emission (due to synchrotron radiation) has so
far been observed at centimetre wavelengths. At millimetre wavelengths, the
stellar winds and the colliding-wind region emit more thermal free-free
radiation, and it is expected that any non-thermal contribution will be
difficult or impossible to detect. We aim to determine if the material in the
colliding-wind region contributes substantially to the observed millimetre
fluxes of a colliding-wind binary. We also try to distinguish the synchrotron
emission from the free-free emission. We monitored the massive binary Cyg OB2
#8A at 3 mm with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer
of the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM). The data were
collected in 14 separate observing runs (in 2014 and 2016), and provide good
coverage of the orbital period. The observed millimetre fluxes range between
1.1 and 2.3 mJy, and show phase-locked variability, clearly indicating that a
large part of the emission is due to the colliding-wind region. A simple
synchrotron model gives fluxes with the correct order of magnitude, but with a
maximum that is phase-shifted with respect to the observations. Qualitatively
this phase shift can be explained by our neglect of orbital motion on the shape
of the colliding-wind region. A model using only free-free emission results in
only a slightly worse explanation of the observations. Additionally, on the map
of our observations we also detect the O6.5 III star Cyg OB2 #8B, for which we
determine a 3 mm flux of 0.21 +- 0.033 mJy. The question of whether synchrotron
radiation or free-free emission dominates the millimetre fluxes of Cyg OB2 #8A
remains open. More detailed modelling of this system, based on solving the
hydrodynamical equations, is required to give a definite answer.","[{'name': 'R. Blomme'}, {'name': 'D. M. Fenech'}, {'name': 'R. K. Prinja'}, {'name': 'J. M. Pittard'}, {'name': 'J. C. Morford'}]","9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &

  analysis based on three dimensional hydrodynamical modelling","X-ray and radio data recently acquired as part of a project to study Cyg
OB2#9 are used to constrain physical models of the binary system, providing
in-depth knowledge about the wind-wind collision and the thermal, and
non-thermal, emission arising from the shocks. We use a three-dimensional,
adaptive mesh refinement simulation (including wind acceleration, radiative
cooling, and the orbital motion of the stars) to model the gas dynamics of the
wind-wind collision. The simulation output is used as the basis for radiative
transfer calculations considering the thermal X-ray emission and the
thermal/non-thermal radio emission. To obtain good agreement with the X-ray
observations, our initial mass-loss rate estimates require a down-shift by a
factor of roughly 7.7 to $6.5\times10^{-7}$ and $7.5\times10^{-7}$ solar mass
per year for the primary and secondary star, respectively. Furthermore, the low
gas densities and high shock velocities in Cyg OB2#9 are suggestive of unequal
electron and ion temperatures, and the X-ray analysis indicates that an
(immediately post-shock) electron-ion temperature ratio of $\simeq 0.1$ is also
required. The radio emission is dominated by (non-thermal) synchrotron
emission. A parameter space exploration provides evidence against models
assuming equipartition between magnetic and relativistic energy densities.
However, fits of comparable quality can be attained with models having stark
contrasts in the ratio of magnetic-to-relativistic energy densities. The radio
models also reveal a subtle effect whereby inverse Compton cooling leads to an
increase in emissivity as a result of the synchrotron characteristic frequency
being significantly reduced. Finally, using the results of the radio analysis,
we estimate the surface magnetic field strengths to be $\approx 0.3-52\;$G.

additional information from new near-infrared spectroscopic observations. We

scenarios with an s-wave dominated annihilation cross section, which mainly
affect the CMB close to the last scattering surface, signatures associated with

  Primordial Spin-Orbit Misalignment be Produced?","Many hot Jupiter (HJ) systems have been observed to have their stellar spin
axis misaligned with the planet's orbital angular momentum axis. The origin of
this spin-orbit misalignment and the formation mechanism of HJs remain poorly
understood. A number of recent works have suggested that gravitational
interactions between host stars, protoplanetary disks, and inclined binary
companions may tilt the stellar spin axis with respect to the disk's angular
angular momentum axis, producing planetary systems with misaligned orbits.
These previous works considered idealized disk evolution models and neglected
the gravitational influence of newly formed planets. In this paper, we explore
how disk photoevaporation and planet formation and migration affect the
inclination evolution of planet-star-disk-binary systems. We take into account
planet-disk interactions and the gravitational spin-orbit coupling between the
host star and the planet. We find that the rapid depletion of the inner disk
via photoevaporation reduces the excitation of stellar obliquities. Depending
on the formation and migration history of HJs, the spin-orbit coupling between
the star and the planet may reduces and even completely suppress the excitation
of stellar obliquities. Our work constrains the formation/migration history of
HJs. On the other hand, planetary systems with ""cold"" Jupiters or close-in
super-earths may experience excitation of stellar obliquities in the presence
of distant inclined companions.","[{'name': 'J. J. Zanazzi'}, {'name': 'Dong Lai'}]","19 pages, 11 figures, accepted by MNRAS",http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03138v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty1075', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03138v2']",astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],10.1093/mnras/sty1075,

  Motions","We report a strong association between the particle acceleration and plasma
motions found in the 2010 August 18 solar flare. The plasma motions are tracked
in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme
UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on the Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory
spacecraft Ahead, and the signature of particle acceleration was investigated
by using Nobeyama Radioheliograph data. In our previous paper, we reported that
in EUV images many plasma blobs appeared in the current sheet above the flare
arcade. They were ejected bidirectionally along the current sheet, and the
blobs that were ejected sunward collided with the flare arcade. Some of them
collided or merged with each other before they were ejected from the current
sheet. We discovered impulsive radio bursts associated with such plasma motions
(ejection, coalescence, and collision with the post flare loops). The radio
bursts are considered to be the gyrosynchrotron radiation by nonthermal high
energy electrons. In addition, the stereoscopic observation by AIA and EUVI
suggests that plasma blobs had a three-dimensionally elongated structure. We
consider that the plasma blobs were three-dimensional plasmoids (i.e. flux
ropes) moving in a current sheet. We believe that our observation provides
clear evidence of particle acceleration associated with the plasmoid motions.
We discuss possible acceleration mechanisms on the basis of our results.","[{'name': 'Shinsuke Takasao'}, {'name': 'Ayumi Asai'}, {'name': 'Hiroaki Isobe'}, {'name': 'Kazunari Shibata'}]","29 pages, 10 figures.

  III. The first global photometric metallicity map of the Galactic bulge","We investigate the large scale metallicity distribution in the Galactic
bulge, using a large spatial coverage, in order to constrain the bulge
formation scenario. We use the VISTA variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey
data and 2MASS photometry, covering 320 sqdeg of the Galactic bulge, to derive
photometric metallicities by interpolating of the (J-Ks)0 colors of individual
Red Giant Branch stars based on a set of globular cluster ridge lines. We then
use this information to construct the first global metallicity map of the bulge
with a resolution of 30'x45'. The metallicity map of the bulge revealed a clear
vertical metallicity gradient of ~0.04 dex/deg (~0.28 dex/kpc), with metal-rich
stars ([Fe/H]~0) dominating the inner bulge in regions closer to the galactic
plane (|b|<5). At larger scale heights, the mean metallicity of the bulge
population becomes significantly more metal-poor. This fits in the scenario of
a boxy-bulge originated from the vertical inestability of the Galactic bar,
formed early via secular evolution of a two component stellar disk. Older,
metal-poor stars dominate at higher scale heights due to the non-mixed orbits
from the originally hotter thick disk stars.","[{'name': 'O. A. Gonzalez', 'affiliation': 'ESO'}, {'name': 'M. Rejkuba', 'affiliation': 'ESO'}, {'name': 'M.

binary 1FGL J1018.6-5856. We measure the orbital period to be 16.544+/-0.008
days using Swift data spanning 1900 days. The orbital period is different from
the 2011 gamma-ray measurement which was used in the previous X-ray study of An
et al. (2013) using ~400 days of Swift data, but is consistent with a new
gamma-ray solution reported in 2014. The light curve folded on the new period
is qualitatively similar to that reported previously, having a spike at phase 0
and broad sinusoidal modulation. The X-ray flux enhancement at phase 0 occurs
more regularly in time than was previously suggested. A spiky structure at this
phase seems to be a persistent feature, although there is some variability.
Furthermore, we find that the source flux clearly correlates with the spectral
hardness throughout all orbital phases, and that the broadband X-ray spectra
measured with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift are well fit with an unbroken
power-law model. This spectrum suggests that the system may not be

mixing above the convective core (overshoot). The component masses are
different enough to exclude a location in the H-R diagram past the point of
central hydrogen exhaustion, which implies the need for extra mixing. Moreover,
we find that current main-sequence models are unable to match the observed
properties at a single age even when allowing the unknown metallicity, mixing
length parameter, and convective overshooting parameter to vary freely and
independently for the two components. The age of the more massive star appears

gamma rays (VHEGRs). During their propagation in the intergalactic space,
VHEGRs interact with pervasive cosmological photon fields such as the
extragalactic background light (EBL) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB),
producing electron-positron pairs. These pairs can upscatter CMB/EBL photons to
high energies via inverse Compton scattering, thereby continuing the cascade
process. This is often used to set limits on intergalactic magnetic fields
(IGMFs). However, the picture may change if plasma instabilities, arising due
to the interaction of the pairs with the intergalactic medium (IGM), cool down
the electrons/positrons faster than inverse Compton scattering. As a
consequence, the kinetic energy lost by the pairs to the IGM could cause a
hardening in the observed gamma-ray spectrum at energies below $\sim$100 GeV.
Here we study several types and models of instabilities and assess their impact
for interpreting observations of distant blazars. Our results suggest that
plasma instabilities can describe the spectra of some blazars and mimic the
effects of IGMFs, depending on parameters such as intrinsic spectrum of the
object, the density and temperature of the IGM, and the luminosity of the beam.
On the other hand, we find that for our fiducial set of parameters plasma
instabilities do not have a major impact on the spectra of some of the blazars
studied. Therefore, they may be used for constraining IGMFs.","[{'name': 'Rafael Alves Batista'}, {'name': 'Andrey Saveliev'}, {'name': 'Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino'}]","14 pages, 8 figures; minor changes to match published version",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13345v3,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz2389', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.13345v3']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.1093/mnras/stz2389,"MNRAS 489, 3836-3849 (2019)"

  ray primary mass in the ankle region","At present there are still several open questions about the origin of the
ultra high energy cosmic rays. However, great progress in this area has been
made in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of
ground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.
In particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic
rays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding
of the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this
generation are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence
telescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast
with the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of
the events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a
calibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in
coincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that
the reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors
becomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small
part of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,
comes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way
depends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in
composition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy
are considered. In this work we develop an analytical method to study these
effects. We consider AMIGA, the low energy extension of the Pierre Auger
Observatory corresponding to the surface detectors, to illustrate the use of
the method.","[{'name': 'A. D. Supanitsky'}, {'name': 'A. Etchegoyen'}, {'name': 'D. Melo'}, {'name': 'F.

  Implications for the CHIME Burst Dichotomy","We introduce a toy model for the time-frequency structure of fast radio
bursts (FRB), in which the observed emission is produced as a narrowly-peaked
intrinsic spectral energy distribution sweeps down in frequency across the
instrumental bandpass as a power-law in time. Though originally motivated by
emission models which invoke a relativistic shock, the model could in principle
apply to a wider range of emission scenarios. We quantify the burst's
detectability using the frequency bandwidth over which most of its
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is accumulated. We demonstrate that by varying just
a single parameter of the toy model-the power-law index \beta of the frequency
drift rate-one can transform a long (and hence preferentially time-resolved)
burst with a narrow time-integrated spectrum into a shorter burst with a broad
power-law time-integrated spectrum. We suggest that burst-to-burst diversity in
the value of \beta could generate the dichotomy between burst duration and
frequency-width recently found by CHIME. In shock models, the value of \beta is
related to the radial density profile of external medium, which in light of the
preferentially longer duration of bursts from repeating sources may point to
diversity in the external environments surrounding repeating versus one-off FRB
sources.","[{'name': 'Brian D.

30 s exposure in the WFS program will reach a depth of 22.27, 23.32, 22.84, and
22.31 (AB magnitudes) in these four bands, respectively, allowing for the

pulsars, with degenerate companions of mass $\ll0.1 M_{\odot}$, three of which
exhibit radio eclipses. The fifth source, PSR J2215+5135, is an eclipsing
`redback' with a near Roche-lobe filling $\sim$0.2 solar mass non-degenerate
companion. Data were taken using the \textit{Chandra X-Ray Observatory} and
covered a full binary orbit for each pulsar. Two pulsars, PSRs J2215+5135 and

marginal orbital variability. The lightcurves for these three pulsars have
X-ray flux minima coinciding with the phases of the radio eclipses. This
phenomenon is consistent with an intrabinary shock emission interpretation for
the X-rays. The other two pulsars, PSRs J0023+0923 and J1810+1744, are fainter

preferred spectral fits yield power-law indices that range from 1.3 to 3.2 and
blackbody temperatures in the hundreds of eV. The spectrum for PSR J2215+5135

mission of ARIANNA-200 is to search for sources of neutrinos with energies
greater than 10^17 eV, complementing the reach of IceCube. An ARIANNA
observation of a neutrino source would provide strong insight into the
enigmatic sources of cosmic rays. ARIANNA observes the radio emission from high
energy neutrino interactions in the Antarctic ice. Among radio based concepts
under current investigation, ARIANNA-200 would uniquely survey the vast
majority of the southern sky at any instant in time, and an important region of
the northern sky, by virtue of its location on the surface of the Ross Ice
Shelf in Antarctica. The broad sky coverage is specific to the Moore's Bay
site, and makes ARIANNA-200 ideally suited to contribute to the multi-messenger
thrust by the US National Science Foundation, Windows on the Universe -
Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, providing capabilities to observe explosive
sources from unknown directions. The ARIANNA architecture is designed to
measure the angular direction to within 3 degrees for every neutrino candidate,
which too plays an important role in the pursuit of multi-messenger
observations of astrophysical sources.","[{'name': 'A. Anker'}, {'name': 'P. Baldi'}, {'name': 'S. W. Barwick'}, {'name': 'D. Bergman'}, {'name': 'H. Bernhoff'}, {'name': 'D. Z.

habitability screening. Transiting planets are present-day ""Rosetta Stones"" for
understanding extrasolar planets because they offer the possibility to
characterize giant planet atmospheres and should provide an access to
biomarkers in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets, once they are detected.
Using the Earth itself as a proxy we show the potential and limits of the
transiting technique to detect biomarkers on an Earth-analog exoplanet in
transit. We quantify the Earths cross section as a function of wavelength, and
show the effect of each atmospheric species, aerosol, and Rayleigh scattering.
Clouds do not significantly affect this picture because the opacity of the
lower atmosphere from aerosol and Rayleigh losses dominates over cloud losses.
We calculate the optimum signal-to-noise ratio for spectral features in the
primary eclipse spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet around a Sun-like star and
also M stars, for a 6.5-m telescope in space. We find that the signal to noise
values for all important spectral features are on the order of unity or less
per transit - except for the closest stars - making it difficult to detect such
features in one single transit, and implying that co-adding of many transits
will be essential.","[{'name': 'L. Kaltenegger'}, {'name': 'W. A. Traub'}]","17 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, to appear in ApJ (accepted) V2:

probe of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Here we
present the most complete study to date of the IGM Lya opacity, and its
application to the redshift evolution of the 'Lya fraction', i.e. the fraction
of color-selected galaxies with a detectable Lya emission line. We use a tiered
approach, which combines large-scale semi-numeric simulations of reionization
with moderate-scale hydrodynamic simulations of the ionized IGM. This allows us
to simultaneously account for evolution in both: (i) the opacity from an
incomplete (patchy) reionization, parameterized by the filling factor of
ionized regions, Q_HII; and (ii) the opacity from self-shielded systems in the
ionized IGM, parameterized by the average photo-ionization rate inside HII
regions, \Gamma. In contrast to recent empirical models, attenuation from
patchy reionization has a unimodal distribution along different sightlines,
while attenuation from self-shielded systems is more bimodal. We quantify the
average IGM transmission in our (Q_HII, \Gamma) parameter space, which can
easily be used to interpret new data sets. Using current observations, we
predict that the Lya fraction cannot drop by more than a factor of ~2 with IGM
attenuation alone, even for HII filling factors as low as Q_HII>0.1. Larger
changes in the Lya fraction could result from a co-evolution with galaxy
properties. Marginalizing over \Gamma, we find that current observations
constrain Q_HII < 0.6 at z=7 [68% confidence level (C.L.)]. However, all of our
parameter space is consistent with observations at 95% C.L., highlighting the
need for larger observational samples at z >= 6.","[{'name': 'Andrei Mesinger'}, {'name': 'Aycin Aykutalp'}, {'name': 'Eros Vanzella'}, {'name': 'Laura Pentericci'}, {'name': 'Andrea Ferrara'}, {'name': 'Mark Dijkstra'}]","12 pages, 10 figures, MNRAS submitted",http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6373v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu2089', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6373v1']",astro-ph.CO,"['astro-ph.CO', 'astro-ph.GA']",10.1093/mnras/stu2089,

  Observation with Ashra","We describe a method of observation for PeV--EeV tau neutrinos using
Cherenkov light from the air showers of decayed taus produced by tau neutrino

utilizing the Earth-skimming tau neutrino detection technique, highly precise
determination of arrival direction is key due to the following issues: (1)
Clear identification of neutrinos by identifying those vertices originating
within the Earth's surface; (2) Identification of very high energy neutrino
sources. The Ashra detector uses newly developed light collectors which realize
both a 42 degree-diameter field-of-view and arcminute resolution. Therefore, it
has superior angular resolution for imaging Cherenkov air showers. In this
paper, we estimate the sensitivity of and cosmic-ray background resulting from
application of the Ashra-1 Cherenkov tau shower observation method. Both data
from a commissioning run and a long-term observation (with fully equipped
trigger system and one light collector) are presented. Our estimates are based
on a detailed Monte Carlo simulation which describes all relevant shower
processes from neutrino interaction to Cherenkov photon detection produced by
tau air showers. In addition, the potential to determine the arrival direction
of Cherenkov showers is evaluated by using the maximum likelihood method. We
conclude that the Ashra-1 detector is a unique probe into detection of very

A-type stars lack slow rotators. The distributions of the surface angular
velocity ratio \Omega/\Omega_crit (\Omega_crit is the critical angular
velocity) have peculiar shapes according to spectral type groups, which can be
caused by evolutionary properties. We aim to review the properties of these
rotational velocity distributions in some detail as a function of stellar mass
and age. We have gathered v sin i for a sample of 2014 B6- to F2-type stars. We
have determined the masses and ages for these objects with stellar evolution
models. The (Teff, log L/Lsun)-parameters were determined from the uvby-\beta
photometry and the HIPPARCOS parallaxes. The velocity distributions show two
regimes that depend on the stellar mass. Stars less massive than 2.5 Msun have
a unimodal equatorial velocity distribution and show a monotonical acceleration
with age on the main sequence (MS). Stars more massive have a bimodal
equatorial velocity distribution. Contrarily to theoretical predictions, the
equatorial velocities of stars from about 1.7 Msun to 3.2 Msun undergo a strong
acceleration in the first third of the MS evolutionary phase, while in the last
third of the MS they evolve roughly as if there were no angular momentum
redistribution in the external stellar layers. The studied stars might start in
the ZAMS not necessarily as rigid rotators, but with a total angular momentum
lower than the critical one of rigid rotators. The stars seem to evolve as
differential rotators all the way of their MS life span and the variation of
the observed rotational velocities proceeds with characteristic time scales

medium of our own Galaxy, and they are ubiquitously observed in diffuse gas in
the halos of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Yet, magnetic fields have typically
been neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their global
influence on galaxy formation largely unclear. We extend our MHD implementation
in the moving-mesh code Arepo to cosmological problems which include radiative
cooling and the formation of stars. In particular, we replace our previously
employed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell 8-wave scheme, which turns
out to be significantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We
verify the improved accuracy through simulations of the MRI in accretion disks,
that reproduce its correct linear growth rate. Using this new MHD code, we
simulate the formation of isolated disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way using
idealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields. We find that the
magnetic field is quickly amplified in the initial starburst and the
differential rotation of the forming disk until it eventually saturates when it
becomes comparable to the thermal pressure. The additional pressure component
leads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulations
without magnetic fields, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures of
the gas disk. In addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outflows
from the disk. These results are robust with numerical resolution and are
largely independent of the initial magnetic seed field assumed in the initial
conditions, as the amplification process is rapid and self-regulated. Our
findings suggest an important influence of magnetic fields on galaxy formation
and evolution, cautioning against their neglect in theoretical models of
structure formation.","[{'name': 'R. Pakmor'}, {'name': 'V. Springel'}]","19 pages, 15 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome",http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1452v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt428', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1452v1']",astro-ph.CO,['astro-ph.CO'],10.1093/mnras/stt428,

velocity space of all stars within 300 pc to the Sun. Its members form a highly
elongated structure with a length of at least 400 pc, while its vertical extent
measures only about 50 pc. Stars in the stream are not isotropically

overdensities, that may correspond to a remnant core of a tidally disrupted
cluster or OB association. Its members follow a very well-defined main sequence
in the observational Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and also show a remarkably low
3D velocity dispersion of only 1.3 km s$^{-1}$. These findings strongly suggest
a common origin as a single coeval stellar population. An extrapolation of the
present-day mass function indicates a total mass of at least 2000 M$_\odot$,
making it larger than most currently known clusters or associations in the

code. Our numerical simulations reveal that the Alfv\'en wave amplitude
decreases as a result of a partial reflection of Alfv\'en waves in the solar
transition region, and that the waves which are not reflected leak through the
transition region and reach the solar corona. We also find the decrement of the
attenuation time of Alfv\'en waves for wider initial pulses. Moreover, our
results show that the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in the arcade is affected
by spatial dependence of the Alfv\'en speed, which leads to phase-mixing that
is stronger for more curved and larger magnetic arcades. We discuss processes
that affect the Alfv\'en wave propagation in an asymmetric solar arcade and
conclude that besides phase-mixing in the magnetic field configuration, plasma
properties of the arcade and size of the initial pulse as well as structure of
the solar transition region all play a vital role in the Alfv\'en wave
propagation.","[{'name': 'P. Chmielewski'}, {'name': 'K. Murawski'}, {'name': 'Z. E. Musielak'}, {'name': 'A. K.

  Signatures in 1083 nm Observations","Atmospheric escape from close-in exoplanets is thought to be crucial in
shaping observed planetary populations. Recently, significant progress has been
made in observing this process in action through excess absorption in transit
spectra and narrowband light curves. We model the escape of
initially-homogeneous planetary winds interacting with a stellar wind. The ram
pressure balance of the two winds governs this interaction. When the
impingement of the stellar wind on the planetary outflow is mild or moderate,
the planetary outflow expands nearly spherically through its sonic surface
before forming a shocked boundary layer. When the confinement is strong, the
planetary outflow is redirected into a cometary tail before it expands to its
sonic radius. The resultant transmission spectra at the He 1083 nm line are
accurately represented by a 1D spherical wind solution in cases of mild to
moderate stellar wind interaction. In cases of strong stellar wind interaction,
the degree of absorption is enhanced and the cometary tail leads to an extended
egress from transit. The crucial features of the wind--wind interaction are,
therefore, encapsulated in the light curve of He 1083 nm equivalent width as a
function of time. The possibility of extended He 1083 nm absorption well beyond
the optical transit carries important implications for planning
""out-of-transit"" observations that serve as a baseline for in-transit data.","[{'name': 'Morgan MacLeod'}, {'name': 'Antonija Oklopčić'}]","Accepted for publication in AAS Journals. Associated data and

narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy PKS 1502+036 performed from radio to gamma-rays
during 2008 August-2012 November by Fermi-LAT, Swift (XRT and UVOT), OVRO,
VLBA, and VLA. No significant variability has been observed in gamma-rays, with
0.1-100 GeV flux that ranged between (3-7)x10^-8 ph/cm^2/s using 3-month time
bins. The photon index of the LAT spectrum (Gamma=2.60+/-0.06) and the apparent
isotropic gamma-ray luminosity, L(0.1-100 GeV)= 7.8x10^45 erg/s, over 51 months
are typical of a flat spectrum radio quasar. The radio spectral variability and
the one-sided structure, in addition to the observed gamma-ray luminosity,
suggest a relativistic jet with a high Doppler factor. In contrast to SBS

Seyfert 1 galaxy, radio and gamma-ray properties of PKS 1502+036 are found to
be similar to those of a blazar at the low end of the black hole mass

phase-space volume of unstable orbits, the ""loss-cone"", which take them
directly into the MBH, or close enough to interact strongly with it. The
resulting phenomena: tidal heating and tidal disruption, binary capture and
hyper-velocity star ejection, gravitational wave (GW) emission by inspiraling
compact remnants, or hydrodynamical interactions with an accretion disk, are of
interest as they can produce observable signatures and thereby reveal the
existence of the MBH, affect its mass and spin evolution, probe strong gravity,
and provide information on stars and gas near the MBH. The continuous loss of
stars and the processes that resupply them shape the central stellar
distribution. We investigate relativistic stellar dynamics near the loss-cone
of a non-spinning MBH in steady-state analytically and by Monte Carlo
simulations of the diffusion of the orbital parameters. These take into account
Newtonian mass precession due to enclosed stellar mass, in-plane precession due
to general relativity, dissipation by GW, uncorrelated two-body relaxation,
correlated resonant relaxation (RR) and adiabatic invariance due to secular
precession, using a rigorously derived description of correlated post-Newtonian
dynamics in the diffusion limit. We argue that general maximal entropy
considerations strongly constrain orbital diffusion in steady-state,
irrespective of the relaxation mechanism. We identify the exact phase-space
separatrix between plunges and inspirals, predict their steady-state rates, and
verify they are robust under a wide range of assumptions. We derive the
dependence of the rates on the mass of the MBH, show that the contribution of
RR is small, and discuss special cases where unquenched RR in restricted
volumes of phase-space may affect the steady-state substantially.","[{'name': 'Ben Bar-Or'}, {'name': 'Tal Alexander'}]","30 pages, 20 figures, submitted to ApJ. Fixed a numeric typo (section

  Intermediate Redshift Galaxy Clusters","We analyze the spatial and velocity distributions of confirmed members in
five massive clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.5 < z < 0.9) to
investigate the physical processes driving galaxy evolution. Based on spectral
classifications derived from broad- and narrow-band photometry, we define four
distinct galaxy populations representing different evolutionary stages: red
sequence (RS) galaxies, blue cloud (BC) galaxies, green valley (GV) galaxies,
and luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs). For each galaxy class, we derive
the projected spatial and velocity distribution and characterize the degree of
subclustering. We find that RS, BC, and GV galaxies in these clusters have
similar velocity distributions, but that BC and GV galaxies tend to avoid the
core of the two z~0.55 clusters. GV galaxies exhibit subclustering properties
similar to RS galaxies, but their radial velocity distribution is significantly
platykurtic compared to the RS galaxies. The absence of GV galaxies in the
cluster cores may explain their somewhat prolonged star-formation history. The
LCBGs appear to have recently fallen into the cluster based on their larger
velocity dispersion, absence from the cores of the clusters, and different
radial velocity distribution than the RS galaxies. Both LCBG and BC galaxies
show a high degree of subclustering on the smallest scales, leading us to
conclude that star formation is likely triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions
during infall into the cluster.","[{'name': 'Steven M. Crawford'}, {'name': 'Gregory D. Wirth'}, {'name': 'Matthew A. Bershady'}]","39 pages, 14 figures.

on colloidal micro-Newton thrusters (CMNTs) and a control system that
simultaneously controls the attitude and position of the spacecraft and the two
free-flying test masses (TMs). This paper presents our main experimental
results and summarizes the overall the performance of the CMNTs and control

calibration measurements yield thrust values consistent with the performance

effect all the four CMB power spectra, its effect is most prominently seen in
the CMB polarization power spectra. This suggests that the measurements of the

constraints on $\Omega_{GW}$ are due to measurements of the angular power

their climates and therefore their habitability. Kepler-62f is a 1.4 R$_\oplus$
planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its K2 dwarf host star (Borucki et
al. 2013). We perform N-body simulations that monitor the evolution of
obliquity of Kepler-62f for 10 million year timescales to explore the effects
on model assumptions, such as the masses of the Kepler-62 planets and the
possibility of outer bodies. Significant obliquity variation occurs when the
rotational precession frequency overlaps with one or more of the secular
orbital frequencies, but most variations are limited to $\lesssim$10$^\circ$.
Moderate variations ($\sim$10$^\circ - 20^\circ$) can occur over a broader
range of initial obliquities when the relative nodal longitude ($\Delta\Omega$)
overlaps with the frequency and phase of a given secular mode. However, we find
that adding outer gas giants on long period orbits ($\gtrsim$ 1000 days) can
produce large ($\sim$60$^\circ$) variations in obliquity if Kepler-62f has a
very rapid (4 hr) rotation period. The possibility of giant planets on long
period orbits impacts the climate and habitability of Kepler-62f through
variations in the latitudinal surface flux, where the timescale for large
variation can occur on million year timescales.","[{'name': 'Billy Quarles'}, {'name': 'Jason W. Barnes'}, {'name': 'Jack J. Lissauer'}, {'name': 'John Chambers'}]","15 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables; Revised relative to Referee Reports.

dispersion in the two axes to be $\sigma_\alpha(c) = 13.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ and
$\sigma_\delta(c) = 9.1^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ km/s, using a 2-component, 2-dimensional
model that takes into account the uncertainties on the measurements. This gives
a 3-dimensional velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{3D} = 17.8 \pm 0.6$ km/s
implying a virial mass significantly larger than the observed stellar mass,
confirming that the association is gravitationally unbound. The association
appears to be dynamically unevolved, as evidenced by considerable kinematic
substructure, non-isotropic velocity dispersions and a lack of energy
equipartition. The proper motions show no evidence for a global expansion
pattern, with approximately the same amount of kinetic energy in expansion as
there is in contraction, which argues against the association being an expanded
star cluster disrupted by process such as residual gas expulsion or tidal
heating. The kinematic substructures, which appear to be close to virial
equilibrium and have typical masses of 40-400 M$_\odot$, also do not appear to
have been affected by the expulsion of the residual gas. We conclude that Cyg
OB2 was most likely born highly substructured and globally unbound, with the
individual subgroups born in (or close to) virial equilibrium, and that the OB
association has not experienced significant dynamical evolution since then.","[{'name': 'Nicholas J. Wright'}, {'name': 'Herve Bouy'}, {'name': 'Janet E.

  magnetar spin-down and its implications for radio detectability","The magnetar model has been proposed to explain the apparent energy injection
in the X-ray light curves of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), but its
implications across the full broadband spectrum are not well explored. We
investigate the broadband modelling of four SGRBs with evidence for energy
injection in their X-ray light curves, applying a physically motivated model in
which a newly formed magnetar injects energy into a forward shock as it loses
angular momentum along open field lines. By performing an order of magnitude
search for the underlying physical parameters in the blast wave, we constrain
the characteristic break frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum against their
manifestations in the available multi-wavelength observations for each burst.
The application of the magnetar energy injection profile restricts the
successful matches to a limited family of models that are self-consistent
within the magnetic dipole spin-down framework.We produce synthetic light
curves that describe how the radio signatures of these SGRBs ought to have
looked given the restrictions imposed by the available data, and discuss the
detectability of these signatures with present-day and near-future radio
telescopes. Our results show that both the Atacama Large Millimetre Array and
the upgraded Very Large Array are now sensitive enough to detect the radio
signature within two weeks of trigger in most SGRBs, assuming our sample is
representative of the population as a whole. We also find that the upcoming
Square Kilometre Array will be sensitive to depths greater than those of our
lower limit predictions.","[{'name': 'B. P. Gompertz'}, {'name': 'A. J. van der Horst'}, {'name': ""P. T. O'Brien""}, {'name': 'G. A. Wynn'}, {'name': 'K.

the sub-monolayer regime on realistic analogues of interstellar dust grain
surfaces. About 0.8 monolayer of solid NH3 was deposited on top of an oxidized
graphite surface held at 10 K, partly covered with ASW ice. Ammonia ice is
subsequently exposed to D atoms for different exposure times using a
differentially pumped beam-line. The deuteration experiments of ammonia were
carried out by mass spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption (TPD)
technique. The experimental results showed the formation of three isotopologue
ammonia species by direct exothermic H-D substitution surface reactions:
NH3+D->NH2D+H, NH2D+D->NHD2+H, and NHD2+D->ND3+H. The formation of the
deuterated isotopologues NH2D, NHD2, and ND3 at low surface temperature (10 K)
is likely to occur through quantum tunneling process on the oxidized graphite
surface. A kinetic model taking into account the diffusion of D atoms on the
surface is developed to estimate the width and the hight of the activation
energy barriers for the successive deuteration reactions of ammonia species by
D atoms. Identical control experiments were performed using CH3OH and D atoms.
The deuteration process of solid methanol is ruled by H abstraction and D
addition mechanism, and is almost five orders of magnitude faster than ammonia

or pseudo-bulge) galaxies up to z~0.9 in rest-frame B-band. Their evolution is
compared to that of normal-discs (discs with classical-bulge). The study is
done for luminous sources (M_B<=-20) in two equal-volume redshift-bins
(0.4<=z<0.77 and 0.77<=z<1.0) and a local range (0.02<=z<0.05). The mean
surface-brightness, from z_{mean}=0.89 to z_{mean}=0.04, shows a dimming of
0.79 mag for bulgeless galaxies and 1.16 mag for normal-discs. The
characteristic magnitude, M_B^*, shows an increase of 0.55-mag for bulgeless
galaxies and 0.95-mag for normal-discs. Both dimming and faintness observed
since z~0.9 are more pronounced for the normal-discs by ~0.4-mag. The
size-distribution is log-normal and both bulgeless and normal-discs show a
slight increase in the mean value from z_{mean}=0.89 to z_{mean}=0.04. The
proportion of bulgeless galaxies in the full disc sample undergoes a
considerable decline with decrease in redshift. This along with the larger
dimming and faintness seen for normal-discs suggests that some fraction of the
bulgeless sources switch to the normal-disc morphology with time. To ascertain
the validity of studying morphology in the optical, the properties of the
galaxies observed in both rest-frame B and I-band are compared. The common
sample is more luminous in the I-band but the sizes are larger in the B-band

for the forthcoming large radio surveys. We demonstrate the use of generative
models, specifically Wasserstein GANs (wGANs), to generate data for different
classes of radio galaxies. Further, we study the impact of augmenting the

architectures. We find that this technique makes it possible to improve models
for the morphological classification of radio galaxies. A simple Fully
Connected Neural Network (FCN) benefits most from including generated images
into the training set, with a considerable improvement of its classification
accuracy. In addition, we find it is more difficult to improve complex

derived from ammonia line observations. This information is used to evaluate
formation scenarios and to determine evolutionary stages of the young embedded
clusters S235 East1, S235 East2, and S235 Central. We also estimate the gas
mass in the embedded clusters and its ratio to the stellar mass. S235 East1
appears to be less evolved than S235 East2 and S235 Central. In S235 East1 the
molecular gas mass exceeds that in the other clusters. Also, this cluster is
more embedded in the parent gas cloud than the other two. Comparison with a
theoretical model shows that the formation of these three clusters could have
been stimulated by the expansion of the Sh2-235 HII region (hereafter S235) via
a collect-and-collapse process, provided the density in the surrounding gas
exceeds $3\cdot10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, or via collapse of pre-existing clumps. The
expansion of S235 cannot be responsible for star formation in the southern S235
A-B region. However, formation of the massive stars in this region might have
been triggered by a large-scale supernova shock. Thus, triggered star formation
in the studied region may come in three varieties, namely collect-and-collapse
and collapse of pre-existing clumps, both initiated by expansion of the local
HII regions, and triggering by an external large-scale shock. We argue that the
C235 A HII region expands into a highly non-uniform medium with increasing
density. It is too young to trigger star formation in its vicinity by a
collect-and-collapse process. There is an age spread inside the S235 A-B
region. Massive stars in the S235 A-B region are considerably younger than
lower mass stars in the same area. This follows from the estimates of their
ages and the ages of associated HII regions.","[{'name': 'Maria S. Kirsanova'}, {'name': 'Dmitry S. Wiebe'}, {'name': 'Andrej M. Sobolev'}, {'name': 'Christian Henkel'}, {'name': 'Alexander P.

sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres. Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets can
be highly sensitive to high-precision JWST data. It is, therefore, imperative
to characterise the instruments and noise sources using early observations to
enable robust characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres using JWST-quality
spectra. The present work is a step in that direction, focusing on the NIRISS
SOSS instrument mode, with a wavelength coverage of 0.6 - 2.8 {\mu}m and R ~
700. Using a custom-built pipeline, JExoRes, we investigate key diagnostics of
NIRISS SOSS with observations of two giant exoplanets, WASP-39 b and WASP-96 b,
as case studies. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the different aspects of
the data reduction and analysis, including sources of contamination, 1/f noise,
and system properties such as limb darkening. The slitless nature of NIRISS
SOSS makes it susceptible to contamination due to background sources. We
present a method to model and correct for dispersed field stars which can
significantly improve the accuracy of the observed spectra. In doing so, we
also report an empirically determined throughput function for the instrument.
We find significant correlated noise in the derived spectra, which may be
attributed to 1/f noise, and discuss its implications for spectral binning. We
quantify the covariance matrix which would enable the consideration of
correlated noise in atmospheric retrievals. Finally, we conduct a comparative
assessment of NIRISS SOSS spectra of WASP-39 b reported using different

detected shell-type SNRs. X-ray point sources in CTB 37B coincident with HESS
J1713-381 and in G353.6-0.7 coincident with HESS J1731-347 both have AXP-like
spectra, much softer than those of ordinary, rotation powered pulsars, and no
optical/IR counterparts. The spectrum of CXOU J171405.7-381031 in CTB 37B has a
hard excess above 6 keV, which may be similar to such components seen in some
AXPs. A new Chandra observation of this object reveals a highly significant
pulsed signal at P = 3.82 s with pulsed fraction f_p = 0.31. Analysis of an
XMM-Newton observation of the second candidate, XMMU J173203.3-344518 in
G353.6-0.7, yields only marginal evidence for a 1 s period. If it is not a
magnetar, then it could be a weakly magnetized central compact object (CCO).
Considering that these HESS sources previously attributed to the SNR shells are
possibly centrally peaked, we hypothesize that their pulsars may contribute to
diffuse TeV emission. These identifications potentially double the number of
magnetar/SNR associations in the Galaxy, and can be used to investigate the
energetics and asymmetries of the supernovae that give rise to magnetars.","[{'name': 'J. P. Halpern'}, {'name': 'E. V.

  Array Data Targeted at EoR1 Field","Current attempts to measure the 21cm Power Spectrum of neutral hydrogen
during the Epoch of Reionization are limited by systematics which produce
measured upper limits above both the thermal noise and the expected
cosmological signal. These systematics arise from a combination of
observational, instrumental, and analysis effects. In order to further
understand and mitigate these effects, it is instructive to explore different
aspects of existing datasets. One such aspect is the choice of observing field.
To date, MWA EoR observations have largely focused on the EoR0 field. In this
work, we present a new detailed analysis of the EoR1 field. The EoR1 field is
one of the coldest regions of the Southern radio sky, but contains the very
bright radio galaxy Fornax-A. The presence of this bright extended source in
the primary beam of the interferometer makes the calibration and analysis of
EoR1 particularly challenging. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a recently
developed shapelet model of Fornax-A in improving the results from this field.
We also describe and apply a series of data quality metrics which identify and
remove systematically contaminated data. With substantially improved source
models, upgraded analysis algorithms and enhanced data quality metrics, we
determine EoR power spectrum upper limits based on analysis of the best

s and a multi-peaked light curve at energies of 15-150 keV. It was optically
dark and has been associated with a bright star-forming galaxy at a redshift of
0.345 that is broadly similar to the Milky Way. This is one of the few cases
where a host galaxy has been clearly identified for a dark gamma-ray burst and
thus an ideal candidate for studying the origin of dark bursts. We find that
the dark nature of GRB 090417B cannot be explained by high redshift, incomplete
observations, or unusual physics in the production of the afterglow. Assuming
the standard relativistic fireball model for the afterglow we find that the
optical flux is at least 2.5 mag fainter than predicted by the X-ray flux. The
Swift/XRT X -ray data are consistent with the afterglow being obscured by a
dense, localized sheet of dust approximately 30-80 pc from the burst along the
line of sight. Our results suggest that this dust sheet imparts an extinction
of A_V >~ 12 mag, which is sufficient to explain the missing optical flux. GRB
090417B is an example of a gamma-ray burst that is dark due to the localized

the Advanced LIGO detectors. By prior arrangement, a worldwide collaboration of
electromagnetic follow-up observers were notified of candidate gravitational
wave events during the first science run, and many facilities were engaged in
the search for counterparts. No counterparts were identified, which is in line
with expectations given that the events were classified as black hole - black
hole mergers. However these searches laid the foundation for similar follow-up
campaigns in future gravitational wave detector science runs, in which the
detection of neutron star merger events with observable electromagnetic
counterparts is much more likely. Three alerts were issued to the
electromagnetic collaboration over the course of the first science run, which
lasted from September 2015 to January 2016. Two of these alerts were associated
with the gravitational wave events since named GW150914 and GW151226. In this

uncertainty in the sky position of any gravitational wave event, efficient
searching for candidate counterparts required survey telescopes with large
(~degrees) fields-of-view. The role of the Liverpool Telescope was to provide
follow-up classification spectroscopy of any candidates. We followed candidates

  FastCam","Aims: We search for low-mass companions of M dwarfs and characterize their
multiplicity fraction with the purpose of helping in the selection of the most
appropriate targets for the CARMENES exoplanet survey. Methods: We obtained
high-resolution images in the I band with the lucky imaging instrument FastCam
at the 1.5 m Telescopio Carlos Sanchez for 490 mid- to late-M dwarfs. For all
the detected binaries, we measured angular separations, position angles, and
magnitude differences in the I band. We also calculated the masses of each
individual component and estimated orbital periods, using the available
magnitude and colour relations for M dwarfs and our own MJ-spectral type and
mass-MI relations. To avoid biases in our sample selection, we built a
volume-limited sample of M0.0-M5.0 dwarfs that is complete up to 86% within 14
pc. Results: From the 490 observed stars, we detected 80 companions in 76
systems, of which 30 are new discoveries. The multiplicity fraction in our
observed sample is 16.7+-2.0% . In our volume-limited sample it is 19.5+-2.3%
for angular separations of 0.2 to 5.0 arcsec (1.4-65.6 au), The distribution of
the projected physical separations peaks at 2.5-7.5 au. For M0.0-M3.5 V
primaries, our search is sensitive to mass ratios higher than 0.3. Binaries
with projected physical separations shorter than 50 au tend to be of equal
mass. For 26 of our systems, we estimated orbital periods shorter than 50 a, 10
of which are presented here for the first time. We measured variations in
angular separation and position angle that are due to orbital motions in 17 of
these systems. The contribution of binaries and multiples with angular
separations shorter than 0.2 arcsec, longer than 5.0 arcsec, and of
spectroscopic binaries identified from previous searches, although not
complete, may increase the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs in our

  convection with large ordered magnetic field","Hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of hot accretion flow have
indicated that there is an inward decreasing of mass accretion rate with
decreasing radius. Consequently, we have a flatter density profile ($\rho
\propto r^{-p}$ with $p\propto 1.5-s$ in the case of $\dot{M}\propto r^{s}$, $0
\leq s<1$) compared to the case of a constant accretion rate (($\rho \propto
r^{-\frac{3}{2}}$). In order to describe this behavior two models have been
proposed: inflow-outflow solution and convection-dominated accretion flows. We
have studied the properties of a hot accretion flow in the presence of
convection, large scale magnetic field and outflow. We consider an axisymmetric
viscous flow in the steady state. We used the self-similar solutions to solve
the 1.5 dimensional inflow-outflow equations. We have assumed that the
convection as a free parameter in our model for simplicity. We have considered
two components of magnetic field (toroidal and vertical) in this paper. We have
shown that the strong convection makes the inflow accretes and rotates slower
while it becomes hotter and thicker. We have found that the thickness of the
disc deviates from non-convective solutions obviously. We have represented that
two components of magnetic field have the opposite effects on the thickness of
the disc and similar effects on the radial and angular velocities of the flow.",{'name': 'Maryam Ghasemnezhad'},"7 pages, 4 Figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS. arXiv admin

  Observations","Based on the monitoring of the Dusty S-cluster Object (DSO/G2) during its
closest approach to the Galactic Center supermassive black hole in 2014 and
2015 with ESO VLT/SINFONI, we further explore the model of a young, accreting
star to explain observed spectral and morphological features. The stellar
scenario is supported by our findings, i.e. ionized-hydrogen emission from the
DSO that remains spatially compact before and after the peribothron passage.
The detection of DSO/G2 object as a compact single-peak emission-line source is
not consistent with the original hypothesis of a core-less cloud that is
necessarily tidally stretched, hence producing a double-peak emission line
profile around the pericentre passage. This strengthens the evidence that the
DSO/G2 source is a dust-enshrouded young star that appears to be in an
accretion phase. The infall of material from the circumstellar disc onto the
stellar surface can contribute significantly to the emission of Br$\gamma$ line
as well as the observed large line width of the order of 10 angstrom.","[{'name': 'Michal Zajacek'}, {'name': 'Andreas Eckart'}, {'name': 'Florian Peissker'}, {'name': 'Grischa D. Karssen'}, {'name': 'Vladimir Karas'}]","6 pages, 5 figures; to be published in the proceedings of the WDS

  dwarf companion HR 2562 B","Context. A low-mass brown dwarf has been recently imaged around HR 2562 (HD
50571), a star hosting a debris disk resolved in the far infrared.
Interestingly, the companion location is compatible with an orbit coplanar with
the disk and interior to the debris belt. This feature makes the system a
valuable laboratory to analyze the formation of substellar companions in a
circumstellar disk and potential disk-companion dynamical interactions. Aims.
We aim to further characterize the orbital motion of HR 2562 B and its
interactions with the host star debris disk. Methods. We performed a monitoring
of the system over ~10 months in 2016 and 2017 with the VLT/SPHERE exoplanet
imager. Results. We confirm that the companion is comoving with the star and
detect for the first time an orbital motion at high significance, with a
current orbital motion projected in the plane of the sky of 25 mas (~0.85 au)
per year. No orbital curvature is seen in the measurements. An orbital fit of
the SPHERE and literature astrometry of the companion without priors on the
orbital plane clearly indicates that its orbit is (quasi-)coplanar with the
disk. To further constrain the other orbital parameters, we used empirical laws
for a companion chaotic zone validated by N-body simulations to test the
orbital solutions that are compatible with the estimated disk cavity size.
Non-zero eccentricities (>0.15) are allowed for orbital periods shorter than
100 yr, while only moderate eccentricities up to ~0.3 for orbital periods
longer than 200 yr are compatible with the disk observations. A comparison of
synthetic Herschel images to the real data does not allow us to constrain the
upper eccentricity of the companion.","[{'name': 'A. -L. Maire'}, {'name': 'L. Rodet'}, {'name': 'C. Lazzoni'}, {'name': 'A. Boccaletti'}, {'name': 'W. Brandner'}, {'name': 'R.

  Characterization of the Gravitational Wave Background Using PTAs","Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently found evidence for a
nanohertz-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB).
Constraining its spectral characteristics will reveal its origins. To achieve
this, we must understand how data and modeling conditions in each pulsar
influence the precision and accuracy of SGWB spectral recovery, typically
requiring many Bayesian analyses on real data sets and large-scale simulations
that are slow and computationally taxing. To combat this, we have developed
several new rapid approaches that operate on intermediate SGWB analysis
products. These techniques refit SGWB spectral models to previously computed
Bayesian posterior estimates of the timing power spectra. We test our new
techniques on simulated PTA data sets and the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set,
where in the latter our refit posterior achieves a Hellinger distance --
bounded between 0 for identical distributions and 1 for zero overlap -- from
the current full production-level pipeline that is < 0.1. Our techniques are ~
$10^2$--$10^4$ times faster than the production-level likelihood and scale much
more favorably (sub-linearly) as a PTA is expanded with new pulsars or
observations. Our techniques also allow us to demonstrate conclusively that
SGWB spectral characterization in PTA data sets is driven by the longest-timed
pulsars and the best-measured power spectral densities. Indeed, the
common-process spectral properties found in the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set are
given by analyzing only the ~14 longest-timed pulsars out of the full 45 pulsar
array, and we find that the 'shallowing' of the common-process power-law model
occurs when gravitational-wave frequencies higher than ~50 nanohertz are
included. The implementation of our techniques is openly available as a
software suite to allow fast and flexible PTA SGWB spectral characterization
and model selection.","[{'name': 'William G. Lamb'}, {'name': 'Stephen R. Taylor'}, {'name': 'Rutger van Haasteren'}]","22 pages, 13 figures.

extreme Population A (xA) quasars, aimed at the estimation of the chemical
abundances of the broad line emitting gas. Metallicity estimates for the broad
line emitting gas of quasars are subject to a number of caveats, although
present data suggest the possibility of an increase along the quasar main
sequence along with prominence of optical Fe II emission. Extreme Population A
sources with the strongest Fe II emission offer several advantages with respect
to the quasar general population, as their optical and UV emission lines can be
interpreted as the sum of a low-ionization component roughly at quasar rest
frame (from virialized gas), plus a blueshifted excess (a disk wind), in
different physical conditions. Specifically, in terms of ionization parameter,
cloud density, metallicity and column density. Capitalizing on these results,
we analyze the component at rest frame and the blueshifted one, exploiting the
dependence (of several intensity line ratios on metallicity $Z$). We find that
the validity of intensity line ratios as metallicity indicators depends on the
physical conditions. We apply the measured diagnostic ratios to estimate the
physical properties of sources such as density, ionization, and metallicity of
the gas. Our results confirm that the two regions (the low-ionization component
and the blue-shifted excess) of different dynamical conditions also show
different physical conditions and suggest metallicity values that are high, and
probably the highest along the quasar main sequence, with $Z \gtrsim 10
Z_{\odot}$. We found some evidence of an overabundance of Aluminium with
respect to Carbon, possibly due to selective enrichment of the broad line
emitting gas by supernova ejecta.","[{'name': 'Marzena Śniegowska'}, {'name': 'Paola Marziani'}, {'name': 'Bożena Czerny'}, {'name': 'Swayamtrupta Panda'}, {'name': 'Mary Loli Martínez-Aldama'}, {'name': 'Ascensión del Olmo'}, {'name': ""Mauro D'Onofrio""}]","39 pages, will appear in ApJ",http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14177v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/abe1c8', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14177v2']",astro-ph.HE,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.GA']",10.3847/1538-4357/abe1c8,

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, interesting constraints can be placed
on models with non-standard neutrino properties and models where gravity
deviates from general relativity on cosmological scales. In particular, the sum

significant variability in the flux density of Sgr A* in three observations,

variations in the flux density. We derive the physical quantities of the
modelled flare emission, such as the source expansion speed $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$,
source sizes, spectral indices, and the turnover frequency. These parameters
imply that the expanding source components are either confined to the immediate
vicinity of Sgr A* by contributing to the corona or the disc, or have a bulk
motion greater than $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$. No exceptional flux density variation

  bimodal?","The distribution of QSO radio luminosities has long been debated in the
literature. Some argue that it is a bimodal distribution, implying that there
are two separate QSO populations (normally referred to as 'radio-loud' and
'radio-quiet'), while others claim it forms a more continuous distribution
characteristic of a single population. We use deep observations at 20 GHz to
investigate whether the distribution is bimodal at high radio frequencies.
Carrying out this study at high radio frequencies has an advantage over
previous studies as the radio emission comes predominantly from the core of the
AGN, hence probes the most recent activity. Studies carried out at lower
frequencies are dominated by the large scale lobes where the emission is built
up over longer timescales (10^7-10^8 yrs), thereby confusing the sample. Our
sample comprises 874 X-ray selected QSOs that were observed as part of the 6dF
Galaxy Survey. Of these, 40% were detected down to a 3 sigma detection limit of
0.2-0.5 mJy.
  No evidence of bimodality is seen in either the 20 GHz luminosity
distribution or in the distribution of the R_20 parameter: the ratio of the
radio to optical luminosities traditionally used to classify objects as being
either radio-loud or radio-quiet. Previous results have claimed that at low
radio luminosities, star formation processes can dominate the radio emission
observed in QSOs. We attempt to investigate these claims by stacking the
undetected sources at 20 GHz and discuss the limitations in carrying out this
analysis. However, if the radio emission was solely due to star formation
processes, we calculate that this corresponds to star formation rates ranging
from ~10 solar masses/yr to ~2300 solar masses/yr.","[{'name': 'Elizabeth K. Mahony'}, {'name': 'Elaine M. Sadler'}, {'name': 'Scott M. Croom'}, {'name': 'Ronald D. Ekers'}, {'name': 'Ilana J.

  contraction and expansion of cold dark matter haloes","We use ~100 cosmological galaxy formation zoom-in simulations using the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code {\sc gasoline} to study the effect of
baryonic processes on the mass profiles of cold dark matter haloes. The haloes
in our study range from dwarf (M_{200}~10^{10}Msun) to Milky Way
(M_{200}~10^{12}Msun) masses. Our simulations exhibit a wide range of halo
responses, primarily varying with mass, from expansion to contraction, with up
to factor ~10 changes in the enclosed dark matter mass at one per cent of the
virial radius. Confirming previous studies, the halo response is correlated
with the integrated efficiency of star formation:
e_SF=(M_{star}/M_{200})/(\Omega_b/\Omega_m). In addition we report a new
correlation with the compactness of the stellar system: e_R=r_{1/2}/R_{200}. We
provide an analytic formula depending on e_SF and e_R for the response of cold
dark matter haloes to baryonic processes. An observationally testable
prediction is that, at fixed mass, larger galaxies experience more halo
expansion, while the smaller galaxies more halo contraction. This diversity of
dark halo response is captured by a toy model consisting of cycles of adiabatic
inflow (causing contraction) and impulsive gas outflow (causing expansion). For
net outflow, or equal inflow and outflow fractions, f, the overall effect is
expansion, with more expansion with larger f. For net inflow, contraction
occurs for small f (large radii), while expansion occurs for large f (small
radii), recovering the phenomenology seen in our simulations. These
regularities in the galaxy formation process provide a step towards a fully
predictive model for the structure of cold dark matter haloes.","[{'name': 'Aaron A. Dutton', 'affiliation': 'NYUAD'}, {'name': 'Andrea V.

  Presence of Kinematic Substructure","The local escape velocity provides valuable inputs to the mass profile of the
Galaxy, and requires understanding the tail of the stellar speed distribution.
Following Leonard $\&$ Tremaine (1990), various works have since modeled the
tail of the stellar speed distribution as $\propto (v_{\rm{esc}} -v)^k$, where
$v_{\rm{esc}}$ is the escape velocity, and $k$ is the slope of the
distribution. In such studies, however, these two parameters were found to be
largely degenerate and often a narrow prior is imposed on $k$ in order to
constrain $v_{\rm{esc}}$. Furthermore, the validity of the power law form is
likely to break down in the presence of multiple kinematic substructures. In
this paper, we introduce a strategy that for the first time takes into account
the presence of kinematic substructure. We model the tail of the velocity
distribution as a sum of multiple power laws without imposing strong priors.
Using mock data, we show the robustness of this method in the presence of
kinematic structure that is similar to the recently-discovered Gaia Sausage. In
a companion paper, we present the new measurement of the escape velocity and
subsequently the mass of the Milky Way using Gaia DR2 data.","[{'name': 'Lina Necib'}, {'name': 'Tongyan Lin'}]","17+13 pages, 13+14 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01704v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac4243', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01704v1']",astro-ph.GA,"['astro-ph.GA', 'hep-ph']",10.3847/1538-4357/ac4243,

of dark matter structures. In this work, we consider the microlensing effect on
gravitational wave signals from black hole binaries induced by low-mass dark
matter halos that do not retain enough baryonic matter to hold stars. We
clarify systematically when this microlensing effect is relevant and study in
detail its detectability by future gravitational wave observatories. We
consider lensing by cold dark matter halos and by solitonic cores that reside
in fuzzy dark matter halos. Our results show that although the effect can be
detectable at relatively large impact parameters, the probability of detecting
such lensed events is low. In particular, we find that the expected number of
events lensed by cold dark matter halos is $O(0.01)$ per year for BBO and the
expected number of events lensed by solitonic cores inside fuzzy dark matter
halos is $O(0.01)$ per year for ET. In the case that a significant fraction of
dark matter consists of $=O(100 M_\odot)$ objects that are relatively compact,
$R < O(0.1\,{\rm pc})$, we show that the expected number of lensed events per
year ET can be very large, $0(1000)$.","[{'name': 'Malcolm Fairbairn'}, {'name': 'Juan Urrutia'}, {'name': 'Ville Vaskonen'}]","27 pages, 17 figures, ""minor changes""",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13436v3,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/07/007', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13436v3']",astro-ph.CO,"['astro-ph.CO', 'astro-ph.HE']",10.1088/1475-7516/2023/07/007,JCAP 07 (2023) 007

that the DM content interior to 300pc is roughly constant with satellite
luminosity. Finally, if we assume that MOND provides the true law of gravity,
our identification of interlopers implies that four dSphs have mass-to-light
ratios in agreement with stellar population synthesis models, whereas Carina
still has a mass-to-light ratio a factor of two too large and remains a problem

  mass transfer","Recent studies have shown that secular evolution of triple systems can play a
major role in the evolution and interaction of their inner binaries. Very few
studies explored the stellar evolution of triple systems, and in particular the
mass loss phase of the evolving stellar components. Here we study the dynamical
secular evolution of hierarchical triple systems undergoing mass loss. We use
the secular evolution equations and include the effects of mass-loss and
mass-transfer, as well as general relativistic effects. We present various
evolutionary channels taking place in such evolving triples, and discuss both
the effects of mass-loss and mass-transfer in the inner binary system, as well
as the effects of mass-loss/transfer from an outer third companion. We discuss
several distinct types/regimes of triple secular evolution, where the specific
behavior of a triple system can sensitively depend on its hierarchy and the
relative importance of classical and general relativistic effects. We show that
the orbital changes due to mass-loss and/or mass-transfer processes can
effectively transfer a triple system from one dynamical regime to another. In
particular, mass loss/transfer can both induce and quench high amplitude
(Lidov-Kozai) variations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner
binaries of evolving triples. They can also change the system dynamics from an
orderly periodic behavior to a chaotic one, and vice versa.","[{'name': 'Erez Michaely'}, {'name': 'Hagai B.

white dwarf (WD) stars, hotter than ZZ Ceti stars, was predicted in theoretical
studies more than 30 yr ago. However, to date, no pulsating warm DA WD has been
discovered. We re-examine the pulsational predictions for such WDs on the basis
of new full evolutionary sequences. We analyze all the warm DAs observed by
TESS satellite up to Sector 9 in order to search for the possible pulsational
signal. We compute WD evolutionary sequences with H content in the range $-14.5
\lesssim \log(M_{\rm H}/M_{\star}) \lesssim -10$, appropriate for the study of
warm DA WDs. We use a new full-implicit treatment of time-dependent element
diffusion. Non-adiabatic pulsations were computed in the effective temperature
range of $30\,000-10\,000$ K, focusing on $\ell= 1$ $g$ modes with periods in
the range $50-1500$ s. We find that extended He/H transition zones inhibit the
excitation of $g$ modes due to partial ionization of He below the H envelope,
and only in the case that the H/He transition is assumed much more abrupt,
models do exhibit pulsational instability. In this case, instabilities are
found only in WD models with H envelopes in the range of $-14.5 \lesssim
\log(M_{\rm H}/M_{\star}) \lesssim -10$ and at effective temperatures higher
than those typical of ZZ Ceti stars, in agreement with previous studies. None
of the 36 warm DAs observed so far by TESS satellite are found to pulsate. Our
study suggests that the non-detection of pulsating warm DAs, if WDs with very
thin H envelopes do exist, could be attributed to the presence of a smooth and
extended H/He transition zone. This could be considered as an indirect proof
that element diffusion indeed operates in the interior of WDs.","[{'name': 'Leandro G. Althaus'}, {'name': 'Alejandro H.

outflows with typical velocities $v \sim 0.1c$ are a common feature of these
luminous objects. Such powerful AGN winds offer an explanation of the observed
M-$\sigma$ relation linking the mass of the supermassive black hole and the
velocity dispersion in the galaxy's stellar bulge. An extended XMM-Newton study
of the luminous Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 recently revealed a variable
multi-velocity wind. Here we report the detection of a short-lived, ultra-fast
inflow during the same observation. Previous reports of inflows used single
absorption lines with uncertain identifications, but this new result identifies
an array of resonance absorption lines of highly ionised Fe, Ca, Ar, S and Si,
sharing a common redshift when compared with a grid of realistic
photoionization spectra. The redshifted absorption arises in a column of highly
ionized matter close to the black hole, with a line-of-sight velocity, $v \sim
0.3c$, inconsistent with the standard picture of a plane circular accretion
disc. This may represent the first direct evidence for chaotic accretion in
AGN, where accretion discs are generally misaligned to the black hole spin. For
sufficient inclinations, the Lense-Thirring effect can break the discs into
discrete rings, which then precess, collide and shock, causing near free-fall
of gas towards the black hole. The observed accretion rate for the reported
infall is comparable to the hard X-ray luminosity in PG1211+143, suggesting
that direct infall may be a significant contributor to inner disc accretion.","[{'name': 'Ken Pounds'}, {'name': 'Chris Nixon'}, {'name': 'Andrew Lobban'}, {'name': 'Andrew King'}]","7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09373v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty2359', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09373v1']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.1093/mnras/sty2359,

the colours, as well as the R absolute magnitude M(1, 1). The average colours,
absolute magnitude, and spectral gradient are listed for each object, as well
as the physico-dynamical classes using a classification adapted from Gladman

cosmic shear measurements using the concepts of complexity and sparsity.
Complexity, introduced in a previous paper, characterizes the number of degrees
of freedom of the PSF. For instance, fitting an underlying PSF with a model
with low complexity will lead to small statistical errors on the model
parameters, however these parameters could suffer from large biases.
Alternatively, fitting with a large number of parameters will tend to reduce
biases at the expense of statistical errors. We perform an optimisation of
scatters and biases by studying the mean squared error of a PSF model. We also
characterize a model sparsity, which describes how efficiently the model is
able to represent the underlying PSF using a limited number of free parameters.
We present the general case and illustrate it for a realistic example of PSF
fitted with shapelet basis sets. We derive the relation between complexity and
sparsity of the PSF model, signal-to-noise ratio of stars and systematic errors
on cosmological parameters. With the constraint of maintaining the systematics
below the statistical uncertainties, this lead to a relation between the
required number of stars to calibrate the PSF and the sparsity. We discuss the
impact of our results for current and future cosmic shear surveys. In the
typical case where the biases can be represented as a power law of the
complexity, we show that current weak lensing surveys can calibrate the PSF
with few stars, while future surveys will require hard constraints on the
sparsity in order to calibrate the PSF with 50 stars.","[{'name': 'S. Paulin-Henriksson'}, {'name': 'A. Refregier'}, {'name': 'A.

Solar System, are common across a variety of temperatures and planet types. The
formation and distribution of these aerosols are inextricably intertwined with
the composition and thermal structure of the atmosphere. At the same time,
these aerosols also interfere with our probes of atmospheric composition and
thermal structure, and thus a better understanding of aerosols lead to a better
understanding of exoplanet atmospheres as a whole. Here we review the current
state of knowledge of exoplanet aerosols as determined from observations,
modeling, and laboratory experiments. Measurements of the transmission spectra,
dayside emission, and phase curves of transiting exoplanets, as well as the
emission spectrum and light curves of directly imaged exoplanets and brown
dwarfs have shown that aerosols are distributed inhomogeneously in exoplanet
atmospheres, with aerosol distributions varying significantly with planet
equilibrium temperature and gravity. Parameterized and microphysical models
predict that these aerosols are likely composed of oxidized minerals like
silicates for the hottest exoplanets, while at lower temperatures the dominant
aerosols may be composed of alkali salts and sulfides. Particles originating
from photochemical processes are also likely at low temperatures, though their
formation process is highly complex, as revealed by laboratory work. In the
years to come, new ground- and space-based observatories will have the
capability to assess the composition of exoplanet aerosols, while new modeling
and laboratory efforts will improve upon our picture of aerosol formation and
dynamics.","[{'name': 'Peter Gao'}, {'name': 'Hannah R. Wakeford'}, {'name': 'Sarah E. Moran'}, {'name': 'Vivien Parmentier'}]","Invited review for JGR-Planets's Exoplanets: The Nexus of Astronomy

  Bias in LambdaCDM Galaxy Clusters","The use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes hinges on our ability to
measure their masses accurately and with high precision. Hydrostatic mass is
one of the most common methods for estimating the masses of individual galaxy
clusters, which suffer from biases due to departures from hydrostatic
equilibrium. Using a large, mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters from
a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, in this work we show
that in addition to turbulent and bulk gas velocities, acceleration of gas
introduces biases in the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters. In
unrelaxed clusters, the acceleration bias is comparable to the bias due to
non-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced turbulent and bulk gas
motions. In relaxed clusters, the mean mass bias due to acceleration is small
(<3%), but the scatter in the mass bias can be reduced by accounting for gas
acceleration. Additionally, this acceleration bias is greater in the outskirts
of higher redshift clusters where mergers are more frequent and clusters are
accreting more rapidly. Since gas acceleration cannot be observed directly, it
introduces an irreducible bias for hydrostatic mass estimates. This
acceleration bias places limits on how well we can recover cluster masses from
future X-ray and microwave observations. We discuss implications for cluster
mass estimates based on X-ray, Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and gravitational
lensing observations and their impact on cluster cosmology.","[{'name': 'Kaylea Nelson'}, {'name': 'Erwin T. Lau'}, {'name': 'Daisuke Nagai'}, {'name': 'Douglas H.

during the assembly of the first structures in the Universe, in particular
during the formation of Pop.~III and supermassive stars. Their subsequent
evolution is expected to be crucial to determine the mass scale of the first
cosmological objects, which depends on the temperature of the gas and the
dominant cooling mechanism. Here, we derive a one-zone framework to explore the
chemical evolution of such disks and show that viscous heating leads to the
collisional dissociation of an initially molecular gas. The effect is relevant
on scales of 10 AU (1000 AU) for a central mass of 10 M_sun (10^4 M_sun) at an
accretion rate of 10^{-1} M_sun yr^{-1}, and provides a substantial heat input
to stabilize the disk. If the gas is initially atomic, it remains atomic during
the further evolution, and the effect of viscous heating is less significant.
The additional thermal support is particularly relevant for the formation of
very massive objects, such as the progenitors of the first supermassive black
holes. The stabilizing impact of viscous heating thus alleviates the need for a
strong radiation background as a means of keeping the gas atomic.","[{'name': 'Dominik R. G. Schleicher'}, {'name': 'Stefano Bovino'}, {'name': 'Muhammad A.

  SAURON view","Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (PNe) are not only useful as distance
signposts or as tracers of the dark-matter content of their host galaxies, but
constitute also good indicators of the main properties of their parent stellar
populations. Yet, so far, the properties of PNe in the optical regions of
galaxies where stellar population gradients can be more extreme have remained
largely unexplored, mainly because the detection of PNe with narrow-band
imaging or slit-less spectroscopy is considerably hampered by a strong stellar
background. Integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) can overcome this limitation, and
here we present a study of the PN population in the nearby compact elliptical
M32. Using SAURON data taken with just two 10-minutes-long pointings we have
doubled the number of known PNe within the effective radius of M32, detecting
PNe five times fainter than previously found in narrow-band images that
collected nearly the same number of photons. Furthermore, by carefully
accounting for the incompleteness of our survey we could conclude, despite
having only 15 sources, that the central PNe population of M32 is consistent
with the generally adopted shape for the PNe Luminosity Function and its
typical normalization observed in early-type galaxies. Finally, owing to the
proximity of M32 and to UV images taken with HST, we could identify the most
likely candidates for the central star of a subset of our detected PNe and
conclude that these stars are affected by substantial amounts of circumstellar
dust extinction, a finding that could reconcile the intriguing discrepancy
previously reported in M32 between model predictions and observations for the
later stages of stellar evolution. Considering the modest time investment on a
4m-class telescope that delivered these results, this work illustrates the
potential of future IFS studies for the central PNe population of early-type
galaxies.","[{'name': 'Marc Sarzi'}, {'name': 'Gary Mamon'}, {'name': 'Michele Cappellari'}, {'name': 'Eric Emsellem'}, {'name': 'Roland Bacon'}, {'name': 'Roger L. Davies'}, {'name': 'P.

flux selected spiral galaxies within $\sim25$ Mpc, using the CO $J=3-2$ line
observed with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We use the technique of
survival analysis to incorporate galaxies with CO upper limits into our
results. Comparing the group and Virgo samples, we find a larger mean H$_{2}$
mass in the Virgo galaxies, despite their lower mean HI mass. This leads to a
significantly higher H$_{2}$ to HI ratio for Virgo galaxies. Combining our data
with complementary H$\alpha$ star formation rate measurements, Virgo galaxies
have longer molecular gas depletion times compared to group galaxies, due to
their higher H$_{2}$ masses and lower star formation rates. We suggest that the
longer depletion times may be a result of heating processes in the cluster
environment or differences in the turbulent pressure. From the full sample, we
find that the molecular gas depletion time has a positive correlation with the
stellar mass, indicative of differences in the star formation process between
low and high mass galaxies, and a negative correlation between the molecular

  Maintain Turbulence","We have identified outflows and bubbles in the Taurus molecular cloud based
on the $\sim 100$ deg$^2$ Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory
$^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) maps and the Spitzer young stellar object
catalogs. In the main 44 deg$^2$ area of Taurus we found 55 outflows, of which
31 were previously unknown. We also found 37 bubbles in the entire 100 deg$^2$
area of Taurus, all of which had not been found before. The total kinetic
energy of the identified outflows is estimated to be $\bf \sim 3.9 \times
10^{45}$ erg, which is \textbf{1\%} of the cloud turbulent energy. The total
kinetic energy of the detected bubbles is estimated to be $\sim 9.2 \times
10^{46}$ erg, which is 29\% of the turbulent energy of Taurus. The energy
injection rate from outflows is $\bf \sim 1.3 \times 10^{33}~\rm erg\ s^{-1}$,
\textbf{0.4 - 2 times} the dissipation rate of the cloud turbulence. The energy
injection rate from bubbles is $\sim 6.4 \times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
\textbf{2 - 10 times} the turbulent dissipation rate of the cloud. The
gravitational binding energy of the cloud is $\bf \sim 1.5 \times 10^{48}$ {\bf

respectively. We conclude that neither outflows nor bubbles can \textbf{provide
enough energy to balance the overall gravitational binding energy and the

sufficient to maintain the observed turbulence in Taurus.","[{'name': 'Huixian Li'}, {'name': 'Di Li'}, {'name': 'Lei Qian'}, {'name': 'Duo Xu'}, {'name': 'Paul F.

Neptune. Only a fraction of the known centaurs have been found to display
comet-like features. Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is the most remarkable
active centaur. It orbits the Sun just beyond Jupiter in a nearly circular
path. Only a handful of known objects follow similar trajectories.
  Aims. We present photometric observations of 2020 MK4, a recently found
centaur with an orbit not too different from that of 29P, and we perform a
preliminary exploration of its dynamical evolution.
  Methods. We analyzed broadband Cousins R and Sloan g', r', and i' images of
2020 MK4 acquired with the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope and the IAC80 telescope to
search for cometary-like activity, and to derive its surface colors and size.
Its orbital evolution was studied using direct N-body simulations.
  Results. Centaur 2020 MK4 is neutral-gray in color and has a faint, compact
cometary-like coma. The values of its color indexes, (g'-r')=0.42+/-0.04 and
(r'-i')=0.17+/-0.04, are similar to the solar ones. A lower limit for the
absolute magnitude of the nucleus is Hg=11.30+/-0.03 mag which, for an albedo
in the range of 0.1-0.04, gives an upper limit for its size in the interval
(23, 37) km. Its orbital evolution is very chaotic and 2020 MK4 may be ejected
from the Solar System during the next 200 kyr. Comet 29P experienced relatively
close flybys with 2020 MK4 in the past, sometimes when they were temporary
Jovian satellites.
  Conclusions. We confirm the presence of a coma of material around a central
nucleus. Its surface colors place this centaur among the most extreme members
of the gray group. Although its past, present, and future dynamical evolution
resembles that of 29P, more data are required to confirm or reject a possible
connection between the two objects and perhaps others.","[{'name': 'C. de la Fuente Marcos'}, {'name': 'R. de la Fuente Marcos'}, {'name': 'J. Licandro'}, {'name': 'M. Serra-Ricart'}, {'name': 'S.

the stellar oscillations. The photometric signal is predicted to be
proportional to the inverse square of the orbital period, $P^{-2}$, as in the

predicted to be proportional to $ P^{-1}$, and is therefore much larger at long
orbital periods than the signal corresponding to the equilibrium tide

these oscillations and the implications for the detection and characterisation

\Delta\gamma_23 can be explained with the influx of cosmic rays from

magnetic field with moderate strength at the event horizon, leading to the
formation of relativistic jets with moderate luminosity and speed via the

(TTVs) with statistical and dynamical tests. We re-analysed KEPLER Q1-Q17
light-curves of the star, and we independently derived the TTVs. They appear as
strongly anti-correlated, suggestive of two mutually interacting planets. We
found similar radii of the candidates, $1.9 \pm 0.2\, \mbox{R}_{\oplus}$ for
the inner KOI-1599.02, and $1.9 \pm 0.3 \, \mbox{R}_{\oplus}$ for the outer
KOI-1599.01. The standard MCMC TTV analysis constrains the planet masses safely
below the dynamical instability limit of $\simeq 3\, \mbox{M}_{\mbox{Jup}} $.
The best-fitting MCMC model yields $(9.0\pm 0.3)\, \mbox{R}_{\oplus}$, and
$(4.6\pm0.3),\ \mbox{R}_{\oplus}$, for the inner and the outer planet,
respectively. The planets are trapped in 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR) with
anti-aligned apsides ($\Delta \varpi = 180^{\circ}$) at low-eccentric ($e\simeq
0.01)$ orbits. However, we found that the TTV mass determination depends on
eccentricity priors with the dispersion in the (0.01,0.05) range. They permit a
second family of TTV models with smaller masses of $\simeq
7\,\mbox{R}_{\oplus}$, and $\simeq 3.6\,\mbox{R}_{\oplus}$, respectively,
exhibiting two modes of $\Delta \varpi = 0^{\circ},180^{\circ}$ librations. The
3:2 MMR is dynamically robust and persists for both modes. In order to resolve
the mass duality, we re-analysed the TTV data with a quasi-analytic model of
resonant TTV signals. This model favours the smaller masses. We also reproduced
this model with simulating the migration capture of the system into the 3:2

  pollution","Heating by short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) such as aluminum-26 and iron-60
fundamentally shaped the thermal history and interior structure of Solar System
planetesimals during the early stages of planetary formation. The subsequent
thermo-mechanical evolution, such as internal differentiation or rapid volatile
degassing, yields important implications for the final structure, composition
and evolution of terrestrial planets. SLR-driven heating in the Solar System is
sensitive to the absolute abundance and homogeneity of SLRs within the
protoplanetary disk present during the condensation of the first solids. In
order to explain the diverse compositions found for extrasolar planets, it is
important to understand the distribution of SLRs in active planet formation
regions (star clusters) during their first few Myr of evolution. By
constraining the range of possible effects, we show how the imprint of SLRs can
be extrapolated to exoplanetary systems and derive statistical predictions for
the distribution of aluminum-26 and iron-60 based on N-body simulations of
typical to large clusters (1000-10000 stars) with a range of initial
conditions. We quantify the pollution of protoplanetary disks by supernova
ejecta and show that the likelihood of enrichment levels similar to or higher
than the Solar System can vary considerably, depending on the cluster
morphology. Furthermore, many enriched systems show an excess in radiogenic
heating compared to Solar System levels, which implies that the formation and
evolution of planetesimals could vary significantly depending on the birth
environment of their host stars.","[{'name': 'Tim Lichtenberg', 'affiliation': 'ETH Zurich'}, {'name': 'Richard J. Parker', 'affiliation': 'Liverpool JMU'}, {'name': 'Michael R. Meyer', 'affiliation': 'ETH Zurich'}]","15 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables; accepted for publication in MNRAS;

exist in the temporally shifting habitable zone, (ii) the minimum photon fluxes
necessary for oxygenic photosynthesis, and (iii) the lower limits on the fluxes
of ultraviolet radiation to drive prebiotic reactions ostensibly necessary for
the origin of life. By taking these effects into consideration, we find that it
is unlikely for brown dwarfs with masses $\lesssim 30 M_J$ to host habitable

  Field Brown Dwarf Mass Function","We present the discovery of another seven Y dwarfs from the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Using these objects, as well as the first six
WISE Y dwarf discoveries from Cushing et al., we further explore the transition
between spectral types T and Y. We find that the T/Y boundary roughly coincides
with the spot where the J-H colors of brown dwarfs, as predicted by models,
turn back to the red. Moreover, we use preliminary trigonometric parallax
measurements to show that the T/Y boundary may also correspond to the point at
which the absolute H (1.6 um) and W2 (4.6 um) magnitudes plummet. We use these
discoveries and their preliminary distances to place them in the larger context
of the Solar Neighborhood. We present a table that updates the entire stellar
and substellar constituency within 8 parsecs of the Sun, and we show that the
current census has hydrogen-burning stars outnumbering brown dwarfs by roughly
a factor of six. This factor will decrease with time as more brown dwarfs are
identified within this volume, but unless there is a vast reservoir of cold
brown dwarfs invisible to WISE, the final space density of brown dwarfs is
still expected to fall well below that of stars. We also use these new Y dwarf
discoveries, along with newly discovered T dwarfs from WISE, to investigate the
field substellar mass function. We find that the overall space density of
late-T and early-Y dwarfs matches that from simulations describing the mass
function as a power law with slope -0.5 < alpha < 0.0; however, a power-law may
provide a poor fit to the observed object counts as a function of spectral type
because there are tantalizing hints that the number of brown dwarfs continues
to rise from late-T to early-Y. More detailed monitoring and characterization
of these Y dwarfs, along with dedicated searches aimed at identifying more
examples, are certainly required.","[{'name': 'J. Davy Kirkpatrick'}, {'name': 'Christopher R. Gelino'}, {'name': 'Michael C. Cushing'}, {'name': 'Gregory N. Mace'}, {'name': 'Roger L.

wide range of non-Gaussian shapes, including general single and multi-field
models and models with excited initial states. We present a separable,
divergent basis able to recreate many shapes in the literature to high accuracy
with between three and seven basis functions. The basis allows shapes to be
grouped into broad ""template classes"", satisfying theoretically-relevant priors
on their divergence properties in the squeezed limit. We forecast how well a
Planck-like CMB survey could not only detect a general non-Gaussian signal but
discern more about its shape, using existing templates and new ones we propose.
This approach offers an opportunity to tie together minimal theoretical priors

planets. The resulting visible colors and albedos enabled us to group them in
several major classes, which are a simplified view of the diversity shown by
the few existing spectra. We performed a serendipitous search in VISTA-VHS
observations using a pipeline developed to retrieve and process the data that
corresponds to solar system objects (SSo). The colors and the magnitudes of the
minor planets observed by the VISTA survey are compiled into three catalogs
that are available online: the detections catalog (MOVIS-D), the magnitudes
catalog (MOVIS-M), and the colors catalog (MOVIS-C). They were built using the
third data release of the survey (VISTA VHS-DR3). A total of 39,947 objects
were detected, including 52 NEAs, 325 Mars Crossers, 515 Hungaria asteroids,
38,428 main-belt asteroids, 146 Cybele asteroids, 147 Hilda asteroids, 270
Trojans, 13 comets, 12 Kuiper Belt objects and Neptune with its four

reveal well-defined patterns corresponding to different mineralogies. The

with different taxonomic types. All the diagrams that use (Y-J) color separate
the spectral classes more effectively than the (J-H) and (H-Ks) plots used

FTs with a mean magnetic field strength exceeding 50 G. During the maximum

  in core-collapse supernovae: the case of SN 1993J","Some core-collapse supernovae are likely to be efficient cosmic-ray
accelerators up to the PeV range, and therefore, to potentially play an
important role in the overall Galactic cosmic-ray population. The TeV gamma-ray
domain can be used to study particle acceleration in the multi-TeV and PeV
range. This motivates the study of the detectability of such supernovae by
current and future gamma-ray facilities. The gamma-ray emission of
core-collapse supernovae strongly depends on the level of the two-photon
annihilation process: high-energy gamma-ray photons emitted at the expanding
shock wave following the supernova explosion can interact with soft photons
from the supernova photosphere through the pair production channel, thereby
strongly suppressing the flux of gamma rays leaving the system. In the case of
SN 1993J, whose photospheric and shock-related parameters are well measured, we
calculate the temporal evolution of the expected gamma-ray attenuation by
accounting for the temporal and geometrical effects. We find the attenuation to
be of about $10$ orders of magnitude in the first few days after the SN
explosion. The probability of detection of a supernova similar to SN 1993J with
the Cherenkov Telescope Array is highest if observations are performed either
earlier than 1 day, or later than 10 days after the explosion, when the
gamma-ray attenuation decreases to about $2$ orders of magnitude.","[{'name': 'Pierre Cristofari'}, {'name': 'Matthieu Renaud'}, {'name': 'Alexandre Marcowith'}, {'name': 'Vikram V.

  the nearby ultra-compact multiplanetary system YZ Ceti","The nearby ultra-compact multiplanetary system YZ Ceti consists of at least
three planets. The orbital period of each planet is the subject of discussion
in the literature due to strong aliasing in the radial velocity data. The
stellar activity of this M dwarf also hampers significantly the derivation of
the planetary parameters. With an additional 229 radial velocity measurements
obtained since the discovery publication, we reanalyze the YZ Ceti system and
resolve the alias issues. We use model comparison in the framework of Bayesian
statistics and periodogram simulations based on a method by Dawson and Fabrycky
to resolve the aliases. We discuss additional signals in the RV data, and
derive the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the stellar activity
with a Gaussian process regression model. To constrain the planetary parameters
further we apply a stability analysis on our ensemble of Keplerian fits. We
resolve the aliases: the three planets orbit the star with periods of $2.02$ d,
$3.06$ d, and $4.66$ d. We also investigate an effect of the stellar rotational
signal on the derivation of the planetary parameters, in particular the
eccentricity of the innermost planet. Using photometry we determine the stellar
rotational period to be close to $68$ d. From the absence of a transit event
with TESS, we derive an upper limit of the inclination of $i_\mathrm{max} =
87.43$ deg. YZ Ceti is a prime example of a system where strong aliasing
hindered the determination of the orbital periods of exoplanets. Additionally,
stellar activity influences the derivation of planetary parameters and modeling
them correctly is important for the reliable estimation of the orbital
parameters in this specific compact system. Stability considerations then allow
additional constraints to be placed on the planetary parameters.","[{'name': 'S. Stock'}, {'name': 'J. Kemmer'}, {'name': 'S. Reffert'}, {'name': 'T. Trifonov'}, {'name': 'A. Kaminski'}, {'name': 'S.

Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and archival Very Large Array (VLA)
data, we have traced the radio emission to large scales in the complex source
4C 35.06 located in the core of the galaxy cluster Abell 407. At higher spatial
resolution (~4""), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning
31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offset
by about 11 kpc (in projection).
  At 62 MHz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to
210 kpc. At 1.4 GHz and intermediate spatial resolution (~30""), the structure
appears to have a helical morphology.
  We have derived the characteristics of the radio spectral index across the
source. We show that the source morphology is most likely the result of at
least two episodes of AGN activity separated by a dormant period of around 35
Myr.
  The AGN is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of Abell
407. We propose that it is intermittently active as it moves in the dense
environment in the cluster core. Using LOFAR, we can trace the relic plasma
from that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than ever
before.
  Using the the WSRT, we detect HI in absorption against the center of the
radio source. The absorption profile is relatively broad (FWHM of 288 km/s),
similar to what is found in other clusters.
  Understanding the duty cycle of the radio emission as well as the triggering
mechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provide
important constraints to quantify the impact of AGN feedback on galaxy
evolution. The study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphological
and spectral information promises to bring new important insights in this

cosmologists to study the birth of our universe. Unfortunately, most CMB
experiments such as COBE, WMAP or Planck do not provide a direct measure of the
cosmological signal; CMB is mixed up with galactic foregrounds and point
sources. For the sake of scientific exploitation, measuring the CMB requires
extracting several different astrophysical components (CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
clusters, galactic dust) form multi-wavelength observations. Mathematically
speaking, the problem of disentangling the CMB map from the galactic
foregrounds amounts to a component or source separation problem. In the field
of CMB studies, a very large range of source separation methods have been
applied which all differ from each other in the way they model the data and the
criteria they rely on to separate components. Two main difficulties are i) the
instrument's beam varies across frequencies and ii) the emission laws of most
astrophysical components vary across pixels. This paper aims at introducing a
very accurate modeling of CMB data, based on sparsity, accounting for beams
variability across frequencies as well as spatial variations of the components'
spectral characteristics. Based on this new sparse modeling of the data, a
sparsity-based component separation method coined Local-Generalized
Morphological Component Analysis (L-GMCA) is described. Extensive numerical
experiments have been carried out with simulated Planck data. These experiments
show the high efficiency of the proposed component separation methods to
estimate a clean CMB map with a very low foreground contamination, which makes
L-GMCA of prime interest for CMB studies.","[{'name': 'J. Bobin'}, {'name': 'J. -L. Starck'}, {'name': 'F. Sureau'}, {'name': 'S.

equations makes clear the inherently three-dimensional nature of plasma
turbulence, enabling an analysis of the nonlinear properties of two-dimensional
limits often used to study plasma turbulence. In the anisotropic limit k_perp

perpendicular 2D limit retains the dominant nonlinearities that are mediated
only by the Alfvenic fluctuations but lacks the wave physics associated with
the linear term that is necessary to capture the anisotropic cascade of
turbulent energy. In the in-plane 2D limit, the nonlinear energy transfer is
controlled instead by the pseudo-Alfven waves, with the Alfven waves relegated
to a passive role. In the oblique 2D limit, an unavoidable azimuthal dependence
connecting the wavevector components will likely cause artificial azimuthal
asymmetries in the resulting turbulent dynamics. Therefore, none of these 2D

surface reflection from the MgF2 coated optics. Preflight testing of the flight
spare G140L grating revealed ~5% efficiency at 1066{\AA}, and early on-orbit
observations verified that the COS G140L/1230 mode was sensitive down to at
least the Lyman limit with 10-20 cm^2 effective area between 912{\AA} and
1070{\AA}, and rising rapidly to over 1000 cm2 beyond 1150{\AA}. Following this
initial work we explored the possibility of using the G130M grating out of band
to provide coverage down to 900{\AA}. We present calibration results and ray
trace simulations for these observing modes and explore additional
configurations that have the potential to increase spectroscopic resolution,
signal to noise, and observational efficiency below 1130{\AA}.","[{'name': 'Steve Osterman'}, {'name': 'Steven V.

  Open Cluster","We present the discovery of two giant planets orbiting stars in Praesepe
(also known as the Beehive Cluster). These are the first known hot Jupiters in
an open cluster and the only planets known to orbit Sun-like, main-sequence
stars in a cluster. The planets are detected from Doppler shifted radial
velocities; line bisector spans and activity indices show no correlation with
orbital phase, confirming the variations are caused by planetary companions.
Pr0201b orbits a V=10.52 late F dwarf with a period of 4.4264 +/- 0.0070 days
and has a minimum mass of 0.540 +/- 0.039 Mjup, and Pr0211b orbits a V=12.06
late G dwarf with a period of 2.1451 +/- 0.0012 days and has a minimum mass of
1.844 +/- 0.064 Mjup. The detection of 2 planets among 53 single members
surveyed establishes a lower limit on the hot Jupiter frequency of 3.8
(+5.0)(-2.4) % in this metal-rich open cluster. Given the precisely known age
of the cluster, this discovery also demonstrates that, in at least 2 cases,
giant planet migration occurred within 600 Myr after formation. As we endeavor
to learn more about the frequency and formation history of planets,
environments with well-determined properties -- such as open clusters like
Praesepe -- may provide essential clues to this end.","[{'name': 'S. N. Quinn', 'affiliation': 'Georgia State University'}, {'name': 'R. J.

white dwarf (WD) is formed at the termination of the common envelope phase from
a merger of a WD companion with the hot core of a massive asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) star. We use a simple population synthesis code that avoids the
large uncertainties involved in estimating the final orbital separation of the
common envelope evolution. Instead, we assume that systems where the core of
the secondary AGB star is more massive than the WD remnant of the primary star
merge at the termination of the common envelope phase. We also use a simple
prescription to count systems that have strong interaction during the AGB
phase, but not during the earlier red giant branch (RGB) phase. That a very
simple population synthesis code that uses the basics of stellar evolution
ingredients can match the observed rate of SN Ia might suggest that the

we detect amorphous and crystalline water ice features. Using irradiated
accretion disk models, we determine the disk structure and ice abundance in
each of the systems. Combining a model-independent comparison of the ice
feature strength and disk size with a detailed analysis of the model ice
location, we estimate that the ice emitting region is at disk radii >30AU,
consistent with a proto-Kuiper belt. Vertically, the ice emits most below the
photodesorption zone, consistent with Herschel observations of cold water
vapor. The presence of crystallized water ice at a disk location a) colder than
its crystallization temperature and b) where it should have been re-amorphized
in ~1 Myr suggests that localized generation is occurring; the most likely
cause appears to be micrometeorite impact or planetesimal collisions. Based on
simple tests with UV models and different ice distributions, we suggest that
the SED shape from 20 to 50 micron may probe the location of the water ice snow
line in the disk upper layers. This project represents one of the first

and the rate at which they lose mass is a key driver of both their own
evolution and their interaction with the environment up to and including their
SNe explosions. Young massive clusters provide an ideal opportunity to study a
co-eval population of massive stars. We performed 3mm continuum observations
with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array of the Galactic cluster
Westerlund 1, to study the constituent massive stars and determine mass-loss
rates for the diverse post-main sequence population.
  We detected emission from 50 stars in Westerlund 1, comprising all 21
Wolf-Rayets within the field of view, eight cool and 21 OB super-/hypergiants.
Emission nebulae were associated with a number of the cool hypergiants while,
unexpectedly, a number of hot stars also appear spatially resolved. We measured
the mass-loss rates for a unique population of massive post-main sequence stars
at every stage of evolution, confirming a significant increase as stars
transition from OB supergiant to WR states. The range of spectral types
exhibited provides a critical test of radiatively driven wind theory and the
reality of the bi-stability jump. The extreme mass-loss rate inferred for the
interacting binary Wd1-9 in comparison to other cluster members confirmed the
key role binarity plays in massive stellar evolution. The presence of compact
nebulae around a number of OB and WR stars is unexpected; by analogy to the
cool super-/hypergiants we attribute this to confinement and sculpting of the
stellar wind via interaction with the intra-cluster medium/wind. Given the
morphology of core collapse SNe depend on the nature of the pre-explosion
circumstellar environment, if this hypothesis is correct then the properties of
the explosion depend not just on the progenitor, but also the environment in
which it is located.","[{'name': 'D. M. Fenech'}, {'name': 'J. S. Clark'}, {'name': 'R. K. Prinja'}, {'name': 'S. Dougherty'}, {'name': 'F. Najarro'}, {'name': 'I. Negueruela'}, {'name': 'A.

  wind nebula of PSR B0540-69.3","We present high spatial resolution optical imaging and polarization
observations of the PSR B0540-69.3 and its highly dynamical pulsar wind nebula
(PWN) performed with HST, and compare them with X-ray data obtained with the
Chandra X-ray Observatory. We have studied the bright region southwest of the
pulsar where a bright ""blob"" is seen in 1999. We show that it may be a result
of local energy deposition around 1999, and that the emission from this then
faded away. Polarization data from 2007 show that the polarization properties
show dramatic spatial variations at the 1999 blob position arguing for a local
process. Several other positions along the pulsar-""blob"" orientation show
similar changes in polarization, indicating previous recent local energy
depositions. In X-rays, the spectrum steepens away from the ""blob"" position,
faster orthogonal to the pulsar-""blob"" direction than along this axis of
orientation. This could indicate that the pulsar-""blob"" orientation is an axis
along where energy in the PWN is mainly injected, and that this is then
mediated to the filaments in the PWN by shocks. We highlight this by
constructing an [S II]-to-[O III]-ratio map. We argue, through modeling, that
the high [S II]/[O III] ratio is not due to time-dependent photoionization
caused by possible rapid Xray emission variations in the ""blob"" region. We have
also created a multiwavelength energy spectrum for the ""blob"" position showing
that one can, to within 2sigma, connect the optical and X-ray emission by a
single power law. We obtain best power-law fits for the X-ray spectrum if we
include ""extra"" oxygen, in addition to the oxygen column density in the
interstellar gas of the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way. This oxygen
is most naturally explained by the oxygen-rich ejecta of the supernova remnant.

  of a Solar Flare","This paper presents a detailed study of excess line broadening in EUV
emission lines during the impulsive phase of a C-class solar flare. In this
work, which utilizes data from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard
Hinode, the broadened line profiles were observed to be co-spatial with the two
HXR footpoints as observed by RHESSI. By plotting the derived nonthermal
velocity for each pixel within the Fe XV and Fe XVI rasters against its
corresponding Doppler velocity a strong correlation (|r| > 0.59) was found
between the two parameters for one of the footpoints. This suggested that the
excess broadening at these temperatures is due to a superposition of flows
(turbulence), presumably as a result of chromospheric evaporation due to
nonthermal electrons. Also presented are diagnostics of electron densities
using five pairs of density-sensitive line ratios. Density maps derived using
the Mg XII and Si X line pairs showed no appreciable increase in electron
density at the footpoints, while the Fe XII, Fe XIII, and Fe XIV line pairs
revealed densities approaching 10^(11.5) cm^(-3). Using this information, the
nonthermal velocities derived from the widths of the two Fe XIV lines were
plotted against their corresponding density values derived from their ratio.
This showed that pixels with large nonthermal velocities were associated with
pixels of moderately higher densities. This suggests that nonthermal broadening
at these temperatures may have been due to enhanced densities at the
footpoints, although estimates of the amount of opacity broadening and pressure
broadening appeared to be negligible.",{'name': 'Ryan O. Milligan'},"11 pages, 10 figures.

been the subject of many studies. A full understanding of the mechanisms that
drive them and their attenuation has not been reached yet. We numerically
investigate the periodicity and damping of transverse and longitudinal
oscillations in a 3D model of a curtain-shaped prominence. We carried out a set
of numerical simulations of vertical, transverse and longitudinal oscillations
with the high-order finite-difference Pencil Code. We solved the ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for a wide range of parameters, including
the width and density of the prominence, and the magnetic field strength (B) of
the solar corona. We studied the periodicity and attenuation of the induced
oscillations. We found that longitudinal oscillations can be fit with the
pendulum model, whose restoring force is the field aligned component of
gravity, but other mechanisms such as pressure gradients may contribute to the
movement. On the other hand, transverse oscillations are subject to magnetic
forces. The analysis of the parametric survey shows, in agreement with
observational studies, that the oscillation period (P) increases with the
prominence width. For transverse oscillations we obtained that P increases with
density and decreases with B. For longitudinal oscillations we also found that
P increases with density, but there are no variations with B. The attenuation
of transverse oscillations was investigated by analysing the velocity
distribution and computing the Alfv\'en continuum modes. We conclude that
resonant absorption is the mean cause. Damping of longitudinal oscillations is
due to some kind of shear numerical viscosity.","[{'name': 'A. Adrover-González'}, {'name': 'J.

shocks from the SN blast wave, and it has been suggested that these forward
shocks have been causing on-going destruction of dust in the ring. We obtained
SOFIA FORCAST 11.1, 19.7 and 31.5 micron photometry of SN\,1987A in 2016.
Compared with Spitzer measurements 10 years earlier, the 31.5 micron flux has
significantly increased. The excess at 31.5 micron appears to be related to the
Herschel 70 micron excess, which was detected 5 years earlier. The dust mass
needed to account for the the 31.5--70 micron excess is 3--7x10^-4 Msun, more
than ten times larger than the ring dust mass (1x10^-5 Msun) estimate from the
data 10-years earlier. We argue that dust grains are re-formed or grown in the
post-shock regions in the ring after forward shocks have destroyed pre-existing
dust grains in the ring and released refractory elements into gas. In the
post-shock region, atoms can stick to surviving dust grains, and the dust mass
may have increased (grain growth), or dust grains might have condensed directly
from the gas. An alternative possibility is that the outer part of the
expanding ejecta dust might have been heated by X-ray emission from the
circumstellar ring. The future development of this excess could reveal whether
grains are reformed in the post-shocked region of the ring or eject dust is
heated by X-ray.","[{'name': 'Mikako Matsuura', 'affiliation': 'Cardiff University'}, {'name': 'James M. De Buizer', 'affiliation': 'NASA Ames'}, {'name': 'Richard G.

  Trigonometric Parallax with VERA","We report on trigonometric parallax measurements for the Galactic star
forming region G14.33-0.64 toward the Sagittarius spiral arm. We conducted
multi-epoch phase-referencing observations of an H2O maser source in
G14.33-0.64 with the Japanese VLBI array VERA. We successfully detected a
parallax of 0.893+/-0.101 mas, corresponding to a source distance of
1.12+/-0.13 kpc, which is less than half of the kinematic distance for
G14.33-0.64. Our new distance measurement demonstrates that the Sagittarius arm
lies at a closer distance of ~1 kpc, instead of previously assumed ~2-3 kpc
from kinematic distances. The previously suggested deviation of the Sagittarius
arm toward the Galactic center from the symmetrically fitted model (Taylor &
Cordes 1993) is likely due to large errors of kinematic distances at low
galactic longitudes. G14.33-0.64 most likely traces the near side of the
Sagittarius arm. We attempted fitting the pitch angle of the arm with other
parallax measurements along the arm, which yielded two possible pitch angles of
i=34.7+/-2.7 degrees and i=11.2+/-10.5 degrees. Our proper motion measurements
suggest G14.33-0.64 has no significant peculiar motion relative to the

  Evolution","We use high quality K2 light curves for hundreds of stars in the Pleiades to
understand better the angular momentum evolution and magnetic dynamos of young,
low mass stars. The K2 light curves provide not only rotational periods but
also detailed information from the shape of the phased light curve not
available in previous studies. A slowly rotating sequence begins at $(V-K_{\rm
s})_0\sim$1.1 (spectral type F5) and ends at $(V-K_{\rm s})_0\sim$ 3.7
(spectral type K8), with periods rising from $\sim$2 to $\sim$11 days in that
interval. Fifty-two percent of the Pleiades members in that color interval have
periods within 30\% of a curve defining the slow sequence; the slowly rotating
fraction decreases significantly redward of $(V-K_{\rm s})_0$=2.6. Nearly all
of the slow-sequence stars show light curves that evolve significantly on
timescales less than the K2 campaign duration. The majority of the FGK Pleiades
members identified as photometric binaries are relatively rapidly rotating,
perhaps because binarity inhibits star-disk angular momentum loss mechanisms
during pre-main sequence evolution. The fully convective, late M dwarf Pleiades
members (5.0 $<(V-K_{\rm s})_0<$ 6.0) nearly always show stable light curves,
with little spot evolution or evidence of differential rotation. During PMS
evolution from $\sim$3 Myr (NGC2264 age) to $\sim$125 Myr (Pleiades age), stars
of 0.3 $M_{\odot}$ shed about half their angular momentum, with the fractional
change in period between 3 and 125 Myr being nearly independent of mass for
fully convective stars. Our data also suggest that very low mass binaries form
with rotation periods more similar to each other and faster than would be true
if drawn at random from the parent population of single stars.","[{'name': 'J. R. Stauffer'}, {'name': 'L. M. Rebull'}, {'name': 'J. Bouvier'}, {'name': 'L. A. Hillenbrand'}, {'name': 'A.

  z=2.44 and the Outlook for HETDEX","Galaxy proto-clusters at z >~ 2 provide a direct probe of the rapid mass
assembly and galaxy growth of present day massive clusters. Because of the need
of precise galaxy redshifts for density mapping and the prevalence of star
formation before quenching, nearly all the proto-clusters known to date were
confirmed by spectroscopy of galaxies with strong emission lines. Therefore,
large emission-line galaxy surveys provide an efficient way to identify
proto-clusters directly. Here we report the discovery of a large-scale
structure at z = 2.44 in the HETDEX Pilot Survey. On a scale of a few tens of
Mpc comoving, this structure shows a complex overdensity of Lya emitters (LAE),
which coincides with broad-band selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA
photometric and zCOSMOS spectroscopic catalogs, as well as overdensities of
intergalactic gas revealed in the Lya absorption maps of Lee et al. (2014). We
construct mock LAE catalogs to predict the cosmic evolution of this structure.
We find that such an overdensity should have already broken away from the
Hubble flow, and part of the structure will collapse to form a galaxy cluster
with 10^14.5 +- 0.4 M_sun by z = 0. The structure contains a higher median
stellar mass of broad-band selected galaxies, a boost of extended Lya nebulae,
and a marginal excess of active galactic nuclei relative to the field,
supporting a scenario of accelerated galaxy evolution in cluster progenitors.
Based on the correlation between galaxy overdensity and the z = 0 descendant
halo mass calibrated in the simulation, we predict that several hundred 1.9 < z
< 3.5 proto-clusters with z = 0 mass of > 10^14.5 M_sun will be discovered in

supercluster at z = 0.03 to understand the star formation activity of galaxy
groups and clusters in the supercluster environment. Using the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer data, we find no dependence of mass-normalized
integrated SFRs of galaxy groups/clusters on their virial masses. We classify
the supercluster galaxies into three classes in the MIR color-luminosity
diagram: MIR blue cloud (massive, quiescent and mostly early-type), MIR
star-forming sequence (mostly late-type), and MIR green valley galaxies. These
MIR green valley galaxies are distinguishable from the optical green valley
galaxies, in the sense that they belong to the optical red sequence. We find
that the fraction of each MIR class does not depend on virial mass of each
group/cluster. We compare the cumulative distributions of surface galaxy number
density and cluster/group-centric distance for the three MIR classes. MIR green
valley galaxies show the distribution between MIR blue cloud and MIR SF
sequence galaxies. However, if we fix galaxy morphology, early- and late-type
MIR green valley galaxies show different distributions. Our results suggest a
possible evolutionary scenario of these galaxies: 1) Late-type MIR SF sequence
galaxies -> 2) Late-type MIR green valley galaxies -> 3) Early-type MIR green
valley galaxies -> 4) Early-type MIR blue cloud galaxies. In this sequence,
star formation of galaxies is quenched before the galaxies enter the MIR green
valley, and then morphological transformation occurs in the MIR green valley.","[{'name': 'Gwang-Ho Lee'}, {'name': 'Ho Seong Hwang'}, {'name': 'Myung Gyoon Lee'}, {'name': 'Jongwan Ko'}, {'name': 'Jubee Sohn'}, {'name': 'Hyunjin Shim'}, {'name': 'Antonaldo Diaferio'}]","15 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3996v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/80', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3996v2']",astro-ph.GA,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.CO']",10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/80,

The pulse profile exhibits a significant energy dependence, and morphs from a

explained by a spectral hardening during an intensity dip seen between the two
peaks of the pulse profile. We detect a Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature

impact on the morphologies, dynamics and star formation rates of the galaxies
embedded within it, underscoring the need for a comprehensive study of the
properties of such a filamentary network. With this goal in mind, we perform an
analysis of high-$z$ gas and dark matter (DM) filaments around a Milky Way-like
progenitor simulated with the {\sc ramses} adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code
from cosmic scales ($\sim$1 Mpc) down to the virial radius of its DM halo host
($\sim$20 kpc at $z=4$). Radial density profiles of both gas and DM filaments
are found to have the same functional form, namely a plummer-like profile
modified to take into account the wall within which these filaments are
embedded. Measurements of the typical filament core radius $r_0$ from the
simulation are consistent with that of isothermal cylinders in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Such an analytic model also predicts a redshift evolution for the
core radius of filaments in fair agreement with the measured value for DM $(r_0
\propto (1+z)^{-3.18\pm 0.28})$. Gas filament cores grow as $(r_0 \propto
(1+z)^{-2.72\pm 0.26})$. In both gas and DM, temperature and vorticity sharply
drop at the edge of filaments, providing an excellent way to constrain the
outer filament radius. When feedback is included the gas temperature and
vorticity fields are strongly perturbed, hindering such a measurement in the
vicinity of the galaxy. However, the core radius of the filaments as measured
from the gas density field is largely unaffected by feedback, and the median
central density is only reduced by about 20%.","[{'name': 'Marius Ramsøy'}, {'name': 'Adrianne Slyz'}, {'name': 'Julien Devriendt'}, {'name': 'Clotilde Laigle'}, {'name': 'Yohan Dubois'}]","19 pages, 11 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00844v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab015', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00844v2']",astro-ph.GA,['astro-ph.GA'],10.1093/mnras/stab015,

  constraints on the matter density parameter","It is believed that the global baryon content of clusters of galaxies is
representative of the matter distribution of the universe, and can, therefore,
be used to reliably determine the matter density parameter Omega_m. This
assumption is challenged by the growing evidence from optical and X-ray
observations that the total baryon mass fraction increases towards rich
clusters. In this context, we investigate the dependence of stellar, and total
baryon mass fractions as a function of mass. To do so, we used a subsample of
nineteen clusters extracted from the X-ray flux limited sample HIFLUGCS that
have available DR-7 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. From the optical
analysis we derived the stellar masses. Using XMM-Newton we derived the gas
masses. Then, adopting a scaling relation we estimate the total masses. Adding
the gas and the stellar mass fractions we obtain the total baryonic content
that we find to increase with cluster mass, reaching 7-year Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP-7) prediction for clusters with M_500 = 1.6 x 10^{15}
M_sun. We observe a decrease of the stellar mass fraction (from 4.5% to ~1.0%)
with increasing total mass where our findings for the stellar mass fraction
agree with previous studies. This result suggests a difference in the number of
stars formed per unit of halo mass, though with a large scatter for low-mass
systems. That is, the efficiency of star formation varies on cluster scale that
lower mass systems are likely to have higher star formation efficiencies. It
follows immediately that the dependence of the stellar mass fraction on total
mass results in an increase of the mass-to-light ratio from lower to higher
mass systems. We also discuss the consequences of these results in the context
of determining the cosmic matter density parameter Omega_m.","[{'name': 'Tatiana F. Lagana'}, {'name': 'Yu-Ying Zhang'}, {'name': 'Thomas H. Reiprich'}, {'name': 'Peter Schneider'}]","Accepted for publication in ApJ, 11 pages, 5 figures.

compares extinction corrected integrated ultraviolet (UV) emission from
resolved galaxies with color-magnitude diagram (CMD) based star formation rates
(SFRs) derived from resolved stellar populations and CMD fitting techniques in
19 nearby starburst and post-starburst dwarf galaxies. The datasets are from
the panchromatic STARBurst IRregular Dwarf Survey (STARBIRDS) and include deep
legacy GALEX UV imaging, HST optical imaging, and Spitzer MIPS imaging. For the
majority of the sample, the integrated near UV fluxes predicted from the
CMD-based SFRs - using four different models - agree with the measured,
extinction corrected, integrated near UV fluxes from GALEX images, but the far
UV predicted fluxes do not. Further, we find a systematic deviation between the
SFRs based on integrated far UV luminosities and existing scaling relations,
and the SFRs based on the resolved stellar populations. This offset is not
driven by different star formation timescales, variations in SFRs, UV
attenuation, nor stochastic effects. This first comparison between CMD-based
SFRs and an integrated FUV emission SFR indicator suggests that the most likely
cause of the discrepancy is the theoretical FUV-SFR calibration from stellar
evolutionary libraries and/or stellar atmospheric models. We present an

than older stars of similar spectral types and they exhibit signatures of

activity. Our aim is to search for planets around young nearby stars and to

  Resonances in Protoplanetary Disks","Besides the spirals induced by the Lindblad resonances, planets can generate
a family of tightly wound spirals through buoyancy resonances. The excitation
of buoyancy resonances depends on the thermal relaxation timescale of the gas.
By computing timescales of various processes associated with thermal
relaxation, namely, radiation, diffusion, and gas-dust collision, we show that
the thermal relaxation in protoplanetary disks' surface layers
($Z/R\gtrsim0.1$) and outer disks ($R\gtrsim100$ au) is limited by infrequent
gas-dust collisions. The use of isothermal equation of state or rapid cooling,
common in protoplanetary disk simulations, is therefore not justified. Using
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the collision-limited
slow thermal relaxation provides favorable conditions for buoyancy resonances
to develop. Buoyancy resonances produce predominantly vertical motions, whose
magnitude at the $^{12}$CO emission surface is of order of $100~{\rm m~s}^{-1}$
for Jovian-mass planets, sufficiently large to detect using molecular line
observations with ALMA. We generate synthetic observations and describe
characteristic features of buoyancy resonances in Keplerian-subtracted moment
maps and velocity channel maps. Based on the morphology and magnitude of the
perturbation, we propose that the tightly wound spirals observed in TW Hya
could be driven by a (sub-)Jovian-mass planet at 90 au. We discuss how
non-Keplerian motions driven by buoyancy resonances can be distinguished from
those driven by other origins. We argue that observations of multiple lines
tracing different heights, with sufficiently high spatial/spectral resolution
and sensitivity to separate the emission arising from the near and far sides of
the disk, will help constrain the origin of non-Keplerian motions.","[{'name': 'Jaehan Bae'}, {'name': 'Richard Teague'}, {'name': 'Zhaohuan Zhu'}]","Accepted for publication in ApJ, 30 pages, 23 figures, simulated data

repeats every about 165 days. Timing and spectral analysis were performed
simultaneously in the energy band 0.4-78 keV. A spin period of 187.0 +/- 0.4 s
was measured, consistent with previous observations performed in 2007. The
X-ray intensity shows a large variability (more than one order of magnitude) on
timescales longer than the spin period, with several luminous X-ray flares
which repeat every 2-2.5 ks, some of which simultaneously observed by both
satellites. The broad-band (0.4-78 keV) time-averaged spectrum was well
deconvolved with a double-component model (a blackbody plus a power-law with a
high energy cutoff) together with a weak iron line in emission at 6.4 keV
(equivalent width, EW, of 40+/-10 eV). Alternatively, a partial covering model
also resulted in an adequate description of the data. The source time-averaged
X-ray luminosity was 1E36 erg/s (0.1-100 keV; assuming 7 kpc). We discuss the

present an attempt to obtain statistically significant ages: we succeeded in
computing ages for $37$ collisional families. We used a rigorous method,
including a least squares fit of the two sides of a V-shape plot in the proper
semimajor axis, inverse diameter plane to determine the corresponding slopes,
an advanced error model for the uncertainties of asteroid diameters, an
iterative outlier rejection scheme and quality control. The best available
Yarkovsky measurement was used to estimate a calibration of the Yarkovsky
effect for each family. The results are presented separately for the families
originated in fragmentation or cratering events, for the young, compact
families and for the truncated, one-sided families. For all the computed ages
the corresponding uncertainties are provided. We found 2 cases where two
separate dynamical families form together a single V-shape with compatible
slopes, thus indicating a single collisional event. We have also found 3
examples of dynamical families containing multiple collisional families, plus a
dubious case. We have found 2 cases of families containing a conspicuous
subfamily, such that it is possible to measure the slope of a distinct V-shape,
thus the age of the secondary collision. We also provide data on the central
gaps appearing in some families.

  mean-field theories and examples from accretion disc modeling","Despite spatial and temporal fluctuations in turbulent astrophysical systems,
mean-field theories can be used to describe their secular evolution. However,
observations taken over time scales much shorter than dynamical time scales
capture a system in a single state of its turbulence ensemble. Comparing with
mean-field theory can falsify the latter only if the theory is additionally
supplied with a quantified precision. The central limit theorem provides
appropriate estimates to the precision only when fluctuations contribute
linearly to an observable and with constant coherent scales. Here we introduce
an error propagation formula that relaxes both limitations, allowing for
nonlinear functional forms of observables and inhomogeneous coherent scales and
amplitudes of fluctuations. The method is exemplified in the context of
accretion disc theories, where inhomogeneous fluctuations in the surface
temperature are propagated to the disc emission spectrum--the latter being a
nonlinear and non-local function of the former. The derived precision depends
non-monotonically on emission frequency. Using the same method, we investigate
how binned spectral fluctuations in telescope data change with the spectral
resolving power. We discuss the broader implications for falsifiability of a

d/sdL7 SDSS J14162408+1348263A (J1416A) and an updated SED for SDSS
J14162408+1348263B (J1416B). We also present the first retrieval analysis of
J1416A using the Brewster retrieval code base and the second retrieval of
J1416B. We find that the primary is best fit by a non-grey cloud opacity with a
power-law wavelength dependence, but is indistinguishable between the type of
cloud parameterization. J1416B is best fit by a cloud-free model, consistent
with the results from Line et al. (2017). Most fundamental parameters derived
via SEDs and retrievals are consistent within 1 sigma for both J1416A and
J1416B. The exceptions include the radius of J1416A, where the retrieved radius
is smaller than the evolutionary model-based radius from the SED for the deck
cloud model, and the bolometric luminosity which is consistent within 2.5 sigma
for both cloud models. The pair's metallicity and Carbon-to-Oxygen (C/O) ratio
point towards formation and evolution as a system. By comparing the retrieved
alkali abundances while using two opacity models, we are able to evaluate how
the opacities behave for the L and T dwarf. Lastly, we find that relatively
small changes in composition can drive major observable differences for lower
temperature objects.","[{'name': 'Eileen Gonzales'}, {'name': 'Ben Burningham'}, {'name': 'Jackie Faherty'}, {'name': 'Colleen Cleary'}, {'name': 'Channon Visscher'}, {'name': 'Mark Marley'}, {'name': 'Roxana Lupu'}, {'name': 'Richard Freedman'}]","40 pages, 25 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01224v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/abbee2', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01224v1']",astro-ph.SR,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.EP']",10.3847/1538-4357/abbee2,

timescales ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Such modulations have
usually been associated with the phenomenon of subpulse drifting. A number of
recent studies have shown subpulse drifting to exhibit very specific physical
characteristics : i) drifting is seen only in conal components of the pulse
profile and is absent in central core emission; ii) drifting pulsars are
distributed over a narrow range of spin-down energy loss ($\dot{E}$), where
pulsars with $\dot{E} < 2\times$10$^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ show this behaviour,
iii) drifting periodicity ($P_3$) is anti-correlated with $\dot{E}$, such that
pulsars with lower values of $\dot{E}$ tend to have longer $P_3$. These
detailed characterisations of drifting behaviour on the other hand also
revealed the presence of other distinct periodic modulations, which can be
broadly categorised into two types, periodic nulling and periodic amplitude
modulation. In contrast to drifting these periodic phenomena are seen across
the entire profile in both the core and conal components simultaneously and are
not restricted to any specific $\dot{E}$ range. In this work we have assembled
an exhaustive list of around 70 pulsars which show such periodic modulations,
22 of which were newly detected using observations from the Giant Meterwave
Radio Telescope and the remaining compiled from past publications. The presence
of such a significant group in the pulsar population suggests that periodic
nulling and periodic amplitude modulations are newly emergent phenomena in
pulsars with their physical origin distinct from subpulse drifting.","[{'name': 'Rahul Basu'}, {'name': 'Dipanjan Mitra'}, {'name': 'Giorgi I. Melikidze'}]","16 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables. Additional 103 figures in appendix.

locally isothermal disk, with moderate turbulent viscosity (~0.0005 < alpha <
~0.05), based on three-dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations. The
radial gradients (in a dimensionless logarithmic form) of density and
temperature are assumed to be constant near the planet. We find that the torque
is roughly equally sensitive to the surface density and temperature radial
gradients. Both gradients contribute to inward migration when they are
negative. Our results indicate that two-dimensional calculations with a
smoothed planet potential, used to account for the effects of the third
dimension, do not accurately determine the effects of density and temperature
gradients on the three-dimensional torque. The results suggest that
substantially slowing or stopping planet migration by means of changes in disk
opacity or shadowing is difficult and appears unlikely for a disk that is
locally isothermal. The scalings of the torque and torque density with planet
mass and gas sound speed follow the expectations of linear theory. We also
determine an improved formula for the torque density distribution that can be
used in one-dimensional long-term evolution studies of planets embedded in
locally isothermal disks. This formula can be also applied in the presence of
mildly varying radial gradients and of planets that open gaps. We illustrate
its use in the case of migrating super-Earths and determine some conditions
sufficient for survival.","[{'name': ""Gennaro D'Angelo""}, {'name': 'Stephen H. Lubow'}]","20 pages, 16 figures. To appear in The Astrophysical Journal. Updated

periods ($\textit{P} < 1$ day), and TOI-1807b is one such planet recently
discovered by the TESS mission where it orbits in the TOI-1807 system that is
still little known nowadays. In this paper, we re-analyzed the transit light
curves of TOI-1807 using the latest TESS data from Sector 49, combined with
previous data from Sector 22 and 23. By running the MCMC simulation through all
three sectors, we found that our transit model fits the data from Sector 49 the
best, and we deduced that TOI-1807b is a Super-Earth with a mass of
$2.27^{+0.49}_{-0.58}\, M_\oplus$, a radius of $1.37^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\,
R_\oplus$, a density of $0.875^{+0.264}_{-0.285}\, \rho_\oplus$, and a surface
temperature of $1499^{+82}_{-129}\, \mathrm{K}$. We confirmed that TOI-1807b
orbits at approximately $0.0135^{+0.0013}_{-0.0022}\, \mathrm{AU}$ with a
period of $0.54929^{+0.00012}_{-0.00005}\, \mathrm{days}$, which raises the
possibility of the planet being tidally locked due to spin-orbit
synchronization. In addition, we suggest that TOI-1807b might slowly undergo
its orbital decay process, and we further identify that TOI-1807b is in a
circular, synchronous orbit and permanently deformed due to tides, leading to
$\sim$4% correction in density. Since TOI-1807 is such a young star with an age
of only $300 \pm 80\, \mathrm{Myr}$, we also imply that the radiation emitted
from active TOI-1807 could be so intense that it might have destroyed most of

(hereafter MACS J0717), an extremely X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=0.55.
Observations at different wavelengths reveal a complex and dynamically very
active cluster, whose core is connected to a large scale filament extended over
several Mpc. Using multi-passband imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we identify 15 multiply imaged
systems across the full field of view of ACS, five of which we confirmed
spectroscopically in groundbased follow-up observations with the Keck
telescope. We use these multiply imaged systems to constrain a parametric model
of the mass distribution in the cluster core, employing a new parallelized
version of the Lenstool software. The main result is that the most probable
description of the mass distribution comprises four cluster-scale dark matter
haloes. The total mass distribution follows the light distribution but strongly
deviates from the distribution of the intra-cluster gas as traced by the X-ray
surface brightness. This confirms the complex morphology proposed by previous
studies. We interpret this segregation of collisional and collisionless matter
as strong evidence of multiple mergers and ongoing dynamical activity. MACS
J0717 thus constitutes one of the most disturbed clusters presently known and,
featuring a projected mass within the ACS field of view (R=150""=960 kpc) of
2.11 +- 0.23 x 10^{15} M_{sun}, the system is also one of the most massive
known.","[{'name': 'M. Limousin'}, {'name': 'H. Ebeling'}, {'name': 'J. Richard'}, {'name': 'A. M. Swinbank'}, {'name': 'G. P. Smith'}, {'name': 'M. Jauzac'}, {'name': 'S.

  surveys","Weak lensing peak counts are a powerful statistical tool for constraining
cosmological parameters. So far, this method has been applied only to surveys
with relatively small areas, up to several hundred square degrees. As future
surveys will provide weak lensing datasets with size of thousands of square
degrees, the demand on the theoretical prediction of the peak statistics will
become heightened. In particular, large simulations of increased cosmological
volume are required. In this work, we investigate the possibility of using
simulations generated with the fast Comoving-Lagrangian acceleration (COLA)
method, coupled to the convergence map generator Ufalcon, for predicting the
peak counts. We examine the systematics introduced by the COLA method by
comparing it with a full TreePM code. We find that for a 2000 deg$^2$ survey,
the systematic error is much smaller than the statistical error. This suggests
that the COLA method is able to generate promising theoretical predictions for
weak lensing peaks. We also examine the constraining power of various
configurations of data vectors, exploring the influence of splitting the sample
into tomographic bins and combining different smoothing scales. We find the
combination of smoothing scales to have the most constraining power, improving
the constraints on the $S_8$ amplitude parameter by at least 40% compared to a
single smoothing scale, with tomography brining only limited increase in
measurement precision.","[{'name': 'Janis Fluri', 'affiliation': 'ETH Zurich'}, {'name': 'Tomasz Kacprzak', 'affiliation': 'ETH Zurich'}, {'name': 'Raphael Sgier', 'affiliation': 'ETH Zurich'}, {'name': 'Alexandre Réfrégier', 'affiliation': 'ETH Zurich'}, {'name': 'Adam Amara', 'affiliation': 'ETH Zurich'}]","17 pages, 9 figures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08461v2,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/10/051', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08461v2']",astro-ph.CO,['astro-ph.CO'],10.1088/1475-7516/2018/10/051,JCAP 2018(2018) 51

the Lyman-alpha forest transmission observed at z = 6. Our calculations agree
with the suggestion of simpler models that the comoving ionizing emissivity was

  connection with the small scale crisis of cold dark matter","One of the open questions in modern cosmology is the small scale crisis of
the cold dark matter paradigm. Increasing attention has recently been devoted
to self-interacting dark matter models as a possible answer. However, solving
the so-called ""missing satellites"" problem requires in addition the presence of
an extra relativistic particle (dubbed dark radiation) scattering with dark
matter in the early universe. Here we investigate the impact of different
theoretical models devising dark matter dark radiation interactions on large
scale cosmological observables. We use cosmic microwave background data to put
constraints on the dark radiation component and its coupling to dark matter. We
find that the values of the coupling allowed by the data imply a cut-off scale
of the halo mass function consistent with the one required to match the
observations of satellites in the Milky Way.","[{'name': 'Maria Archidiacono'}, {'name': 'Sebastian Bohr'}, {'name': 'Steen Hannestad'}, {'name': 'Jonas Helboe Jørgensen'}, {'name': 'Julien Lesgourgues'}]","7 pages, 4 figures.

  Exoplanet HAT-P-20b Using Pixel-Level Decorrelation","HAT-P-20b is a giant exoplanet that orbits a metal-rich star. The planet
itself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a high
metallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of
the 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel
detector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional
decorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically
different method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which
we call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect
very effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the
fluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and
validate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to
previous analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in
Spitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be
intractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b
eclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating
inefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong
molecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5
micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by
Spitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All
four eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a
slightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with
extant RV data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), and
establishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence.
Given the existence of a bound stellar companion, HAT-P-20b is another
excellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other
three-body mechanism.","[{'name': 'Drake Deming'}, {'name': 'Heather Knutson'}, {'name': 'Joshua Kammer'}, {'name': 'Benjamin J.

  electrons under linear synchrotron, non-linear SSC, and combined
  synchrotron-SSC cooling","The broadband SEDs of blazars show two distinct components which in leptonic
models are associated with synchrotron and SSC emission of highly relativistic
electrons. In some sources the SSC component dominates the synchrotron peak by
one or more orders of magnitude implying that the electrons mainly cool by
inverse Compton collisions with their self-made synchrotron photons. Therefore,
the linear synchrotron loss of electrons, which is normally invoked in emission
models, has to be replaced by a nonlinear loss rate depending on an energy
integral of the electron distribution. This modified electron cooling changes
significantly the emerging radiation spectra. It is the purpose of this work to
apply this new cooling scenario to relativistic power-law distributed
electrons, which are injected instantaneously into the jet. We will first solve
the differential equation of the volume-averaged differential number density of
the electrons, and then discuss their temporal evolution. Since any non-linear
cooling will turn into linear cooling after some time, we also calculated the
electron number density for a combined cooling scenario consisting of both the
linear and non-linear cooling. For all cases, we will also calculate
analytically the emerging optically thin synchrotron fluence spectrum which
will be compared to a numerical solution. For small normalized frequencies f <
1 the fluence spectra show constant spectral indices. We find for linear
cooling a_SYN = 1/2, and for non-linear cooling a_SSC = 3/2. In the combined
cooling scenario we obtain for the small injection parameter b_1 = 1/2, and for
the large injection parameter b_2 = 3/2, which becomes b_1 = 1/2 for very small
frequencies, again. This is the same behaviour as for monoenergetically
injected electrons.","[{'name': 'M. Zacharias'}, {'name': 'R. Schlickeiser'}]","24 pages, 25 figures, submitted to A&A",http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0180v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201015284', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.0180v1']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.1051/0004-6361/201015284,

  X-ray Emission and Broad-Band Modelin","We performed a systematic X-ray study of eight nearby gamma-ray bright radio
galaxies with Suzaku for understanding the origin of their X-ray emissions. The
Suzaku spectra for five of those have been presented previously, while the
remaining three (M87, PKS0625-354, and 3C78) are presented here for the first
time. Based on the Fe-K line strength, X-ray variability, and X-ray power-law
photon indices, and using additional information on the [O III] line emission,
we argue for a jet origin of the observed X-ray emission in these three
sources. We also analyzed five years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) GeV
gamma-ray data on PKS0625-354 and 3C78 to understand these sources within the
blazar picture. We found significant gamma-ray variability in the former
object. Overall, we note that the Suzaku spectra for both PKS0625-354 and 3C78
are rather soft, while the LAT spectra are unusually hard when compared with
other gamma-ray detected low-power (FR I) radio galaxies. We demonstrate that
the constructed broad-band spectral energy distributions of PKS0625-354 and
3C78 are well described by a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton
model. The results of the modeling indicate lower bulk Lorentz factors compared
to those typically found in other BL Lac objects, but consistent with the
values inferred from modeling other LAT-detected FR\,I radio galaxies.
Interestingly, the modeling also implies very high peak ($\sim 10^{16}$ Hz)
synchrotron frequencies in the two analyzed sources, contrary to
previously-suggested scenarios for FR I/BL Lac unification. We discuss the
implications of our findings in the context of the FR I/BL Lac unification
schemes.","[{'name': 'Yasushi Fukazawa'}, {'name': 'Justin Finke'}, {'name': 'Lukasz Stawarz'}, {'name': 'Yasuyuki Tanaka'}, {'name': 'Ryosuke Itoh'}, {'name': ""Shin'ya Tokuda""}]","23 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ApJ",http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2733v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/798/2/74', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2733v1']",astro-ph.HE,['astro-ph.HE'],10.1088/0004-637X/798/2/74,

mobilized by slow velocity impacts. These splashes generated by impacts might
play an important role in sculpting the asteroid's surface. In laboratory
experiments we characterize the ejecta generated by spherical 150 $\rm \mu m$
diameter basalt grains impacting a granular bed at 0.8 m/s. We find that such
an impact typically leads to less than 10 particles being ejected from the
granular bed, with typical ejecta trajectories rising to less than one particle
diameter above the surface. That is, the observed impacts are highly
dissipative and only a small fraction of the impact energy is imparted onto the
ejecta. While the impactor itself still rebounds, it typically slows down
significantly to an average of about 20 % of its impact velocity. Scaled to
asteroids, impactor and ejecta generated from impacts of sand sized grains are
not able to spread over the asteroid's surface but will stay close to the
impact site. Therefore these highly inelastic impacts into soft granular beds
efficiently trap grains, in contrast to more elastic impacts on bare, rocky
surfaces confirming suggestions by Shinbrot (2017). This is also in agreement
to observed features on asteroids as this topological elasticity bias suggests
that redistribution of grains leads to a size segregation.","[{'name': 'Tabea Bogdan'}, {'name': 'Jonathan E.

pressure-supported systems like dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We construct
an estimator for enclosed masses based on the virial theorem which is
insensitive to anisotropy in the velocity dispersion and tailored to yield
masses with minimum uncertainty introduced by our ignorance on (i) the shape of
the inner halo profile, and (ii) how deeply the stellar component is embedded
within the halo: $M(<1.8\,R_\mathrm{h}) \approx 3.5 \times 1.8\,R_\mathrm{h}
\langle \sigma_\mathrm{los}^2 \rangle G^{-1}$, where by $R_\mathrm{h}$ we
denote the projected half-light radius and by $\langle \sigma_\mathrm{los}^2
\rangle$ the luminosity-averaged squared line-of-sight velocity dispersion.
Tests against controlled simulations show that this estimator provides unbiased
enclosed masses with an accuracy of $\sim 10$ per cent. This confirms the
robustness of similar previously proposed mass estimators. Application to
published kinematic data of Milky Way dSphs reveals a tight correlation between
enclosed mass and luminosity. Using $N$-body models we show that tidal
stripping has little effect on this relation. Comparison against cuspy and
cored dark matter haloes extracted from controlled re-simulations of the
Aquarius A2 merger tree shows that the high mass densities of ultrafaint
galaxies are not compatible with large dark matter cores, and that the (total)
halo masses of the classical Milky Way dSphs span a remarkably narrow range ($8
\lesssim \mathrm{log_{10}}\,(M/\mathrm{M_\odot}) \lesssim 10$) at present,
showing no clear trend with either galaxy size or luminosity.","[{'name': 'Raphaël Errani'}, {'name': 'Jorge Peñarrubia'}, {'name': 'Matthew G. Walker'}]","18 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS. Edited to

determination of cosmological parameters describing the matter and energy
content of the Universe. However, the standard methods rely on various

present a novel method of measuring cluster masses. It is complementary to most
of the other methods, since it only uses kinematical information from outside
the virialized cluster. Our method identifies objects, as galaxy sheets or
filaments, in the cluster outer region, and infers the cluster mass by modeling
how the massive cluster perturbs the motion of the structures from the Hubble
flow. At the same time, this technique allows to constrain the
three-dimensional orientation of the detected structures with a good accuracy.
We use a cosmological numerical simulation to test the method. We then apply
the method to the Coma cluster, where we find two galaxy sheets, and measure
the mass of Coma to be Mvir=(9.2\pm2.4)10^{14} Msol, in good agreement with
previous measurements obtained with the standard methods.","[{'name': 'Martina Falco', 'affiliation': 'Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark'}, {'name': 'Steen H.

  emission line star VFTS 399","The stellar population of the 30 Doradus star-forming region in the Large
Magellanic Cloud contains a subset of apparently single, rapidly rotating
O-type stars. The physical processes leading to the formation of this cohort
are currently uncertain. One member of this group, the late O-type star VFTS
399, is found to be unexpectedly X-ray bright for its bolometric luminosity -
in this study we aim to determine its physical nature and the cause of this
behaviour. We find VFTS 399 to be an aperiodic photometric variable with an
apparent near-IR excess. Its optical spectrum demonstrates complex emission
profiles in the lower Balmer series and select HeI lines - taken together these
suggest an OeBe classification. The highly variable X-ray luminosity is too
great to be produced by a single star, while the hard, non-thermal nature
suggests the presence of an accreting relativistic companion. Finally, the
detection of periodic modulation of the X-ray lightcurve is most naturally
explained under the assumption that the accretor is a neutron star. VFTS 399
appears to be the first high-mass X-ray binary identified within 30 Dor.
Comparison of the current properties of VFTS 399 to binary-evolution models
suggests a progenitor mass in excess of 25Msun for the putative neutron star,
which may host a magnetic field comparable in strength to those of magnetars.
VFTS 399 is now the second member of the cohort of rapidly rotating `single'
O-type stars in 30 Dor to show evidence of binary interaction resulting in
spin-up, suggesting that this may be a viable evolutionary pathway for the
formation of a subset of this stellar population.","[{'name': 'J. S. Clark'}, {'name': 'E. S. Bartlett'}, {'name': 'P. S. Broos'}, {'name': 'L. K. Townsley'}, {'name': 'W. D. Taylor'}, {'name': 'N.

luminosity slowly decayed. We used XMM-Newton to observe the system during this

on gravitational-wave signals is also addressed through software signal
injection and parameter estimation of the recovered signal. It is shown that
the optimal SNR ratio of the injected signal is enhanced by $\sim 21.6\%$ and
the recovered parameters are consistent with the injected set. We present the
performance of this algorithm on linear and non-linear noise sources and
discuss its impact on astrophysical searches by gravitational wave detectors.","[{'name': 'Rich Ormiston'}, {'name': 'Tri Nguyen'}, {'name': 'Michael Coughlin'}, {'name': 'Rana X.

  search for variability","Context: Extended circumstellar emission has been detected within a few 100
milli-arcsec around > 10% of nearby main sequence stars using near-infrared
interferometry. Follow-up observations using other techniques, should they
yield similar results or non-detections, can provide strong constraints on the
origin of the emission. They can also reveal the variability of the phenomenon.
  Aims: We aim to demonstrate the persistence of the phenomenon over time
scales of a few years and to search for variability of our previously detected
excesses.
  Methods: Using VLTI/PIONIER in H band we have carried out multi-epoch
observations of the stars for which a near-infrared excess was previously
detected with the same observing technique and instrument. The detection rates
and distribution of the excesses from our original survey and the follow-up
observations are compared statistically. A search for variability of the
excesses in our time series is carried out based on the level of the broadband
excesses.
  Results: In 12 of 16 follow-up observations, an excess is re-detected with a
significance of > 2 sigma, and in 7 of 16 follow-up observations significant
excess (> 3 sigma) has been re-detected. We statistically demonstrate with very
high confidence that the phenomenon persists for the majority of the systems.
We also present the first detection of potential variability in two sources.
  Conclusions: We conclude that the phenomenon responsible for the excesses
persists over time scales of a few years for the majority of the systems.
However, we also find that variability intrinsic to a target can cause it to
have no significant excess at the time of a specific observation.","[{'name': 'S. Ertel'}, {'name': 'D. Defrère'}, {'name': 'O. Absil'}, {'name': 'J. -B. Le Bouquin'}, {'name': 'J. -C.

resulted from dwarf-dwarf galaxy merging, but unequivocal evidence for this
possibility has rarely been reported in the literature. We present the first
study of deep optical broadband images of a gas-dominated blue compact dwarf
galaxy (BCD) VCC848 (Mstar=2e8Msun) which hosts extended stellar shells and
thus is confirmed to be a dwarf-dwarf merger. VCC848 is located in the
outskirts of the Virgo Cluster. By analyzing the stellar light distribution, we
found that VCC848 is the result of a merging between two dwarf galaxies with a
primary-to-secondary mass ratio < ~ 5 for the stellar components and < ~ 2 for
the presumed dark matter halos. The secondary progenitor galaxy has been almost
entirely disrupted. The age-mass distribution of photometrically selected star
cluster candidates in VCC848 implies that the cluster formation rate (CFR,
proportional to star formation rate) was enhanced by a factor of ~ 7 - 10
during the past 1 Gyr. The merging-induced enhancement of CFR peaked near the
galactic center a few hundred Myr ago and has started declining in the last few
tens of Myr. The current star formation activities, as traced by the youngest
clusters, mainly occur at large galactocentric distances (> ~ 1 kpc). The fact
that VCC848 is still (atomic) gas-dominated after the period of most violent
collision suggests that gas-rich dwarf galaxy merging can result in BCD-like
remnants with extended atomic gas distribution surrounding a blue compact
center, in general agreement with previous numerical simulations.","[{'name': 'Hong-Xin Zhang', 'affiliation': 'USTC'}, {'name': 'Sanjaya Paudel', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei Univ'}, {'name': 'Rory Smith', 'affiliation': 'KASI'}, {'name': 'Pierre-Alain Duc', 'affiliation': 'Univ of Strasburg'}, {'name': 'Thomas H.

  binaries","The hard to soft state transition of the outbursts in X-ray binaries (XRBs)
is triggered by the rising of the mass accretion rate due to the disk
instability. In order to explain the observed correlation between the hard
X-ray transition luminosity and the soft X-ray peak luminosity in the soft
state, we construct a magnetic disk-outflow model for the state transition in
XRBs. We assume that the large-scale magnetic field in the outer thin disk is
formed through inverse cascade of small-scale dynamo generated field, and it is
then advected by the inner advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF), which
accelerates a fraction of the gas into the outflows. During the outbursts, the
heating front moves inwards, and the field strength at the heating front of the
outer disk is proportional to the accretion rate of the disk. Much angular
momentum of the inner ADAF is carried away by the outflows for a stronger
magnetic field, which leads to a high radial velocity of the ADAF. This makes
the critical mass accretion rate of the ADAF increases with the field strength,
and it therefore leads to a correlation between transition luminosity and the
peak luminosity in the thermal state. We found that the values of the viscosity
parameter $\alpha$ of the neutron star XRBs are systematically higher for those
of the black hole (BH) XRBs ($\alpha\sim 0.05-0.15$ for BHs, and $\alpha\sim
0.15-0.4$ for neutron stars). Our model predicts the transition luminosity may
be higher than the peak luminosity provided $\alpha$ is sufficiently high,
which is able to explain a substantial fraction of outbursts in BHXRBs not
reaching the thermally dominant accretion state.","[{'name': 'Xinwu Cao', 'affiliation': 'Zhejiang Univ.'}, {'name': 'Bei You', 'affiliation': 'Wuhan Univ.'}, {'name': 'Zhen Yan', 'affiliation': 'SHAO'}]","accepted by A&A, 7 pages",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09110v1,"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202141652', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09110v1']",astro-ph.HE,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.SR']",10.1051/0004-6361/202141652,"A&A 654, A81 (2021)"

  Galaxies: The Measurement, Systematics and Cosmological Implications","The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) surveyed 14,555 square degrees, and
delivered over a trillion pixels of imaging data. We present a study of galaxy
clustering using 900,000 luminous galaxies with photometric redshifts, spanning
between $z=0.45$ and $z=0.65$, constructed from the SDSS using methods
described in Ross et al. (2011). This data-set spans 11,000 square degrees and
probes a volume of $3h^{-3} \rm{Gpc}^3$, making it the largest volume ever used
for galaxy clustering measurements. We present a novel treatment of the
observational systematics and its applications to the clustering signals from
the data set. In this paper, we measure the angular clustering using an optimal
quadratic estimator at 4 redshift slices with an accuracy of ~15% with bin size
of delta_l = 10 on scales of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (at
l~40-400). We derive cosmological constraints using the full-shape of the
power-spectra. For a flat Lambda CDM model, when combined with Cosmic Microwave
Background Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 (WMAP7) and H_0 constraints
from 600 Cepheids observed by HST, we find \Omega_\Lambda = 0.73 +/- 0.019 and
H_0 to be 70.5 +/- 1.6 km/s/Mpc. For an open Lambda CDM model, when combined
with WMAP7 + HST, we find $\Omega_K = 0.0035 +/- 0.0054, improved over
WMAP7+HST alone by 40%. For a wCDM model, when combined with WMAP7+HST+SN, we
find w = -1.071 +/- 0.078, and H_0 to be 71.3 +/- 1.7 km/s/Mpc, which is
competitive with the latest large scale structure constraints from large
spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) (Reid et al. 2010,

  Years","How often do bright optical transients occur on the sky but go unreported? To
constrain the bright end of the astronomical transient function, a systematic
search for transients that become bright enough to be noticed by the unaided
eye was conducted using the all-sky monitors of the Night Sky Live network. Two
fisheye continuous cameras (CONCAMs) operating over three years created a data
base that was searched for transients that appeared in time-contiguous CCD
frames. Although a single candidate transient was found (Nemiroff and Shamir

general frequency of bright transients. To be detected, a transient must have
increased by over three visual magnitudes to become brighter than visual
magnitude 5.5 on the time scale of minutes to years. It is concluded that, on
the average, fewer than 0.0040 ($t_{dur} / 60$ seconds) transients with
duration $t_{dur}$ between minutes and hours, occur anywhere on the sky at any

inspection of high-magnification microlensing events, with peak magnifications

the lensing light curve of the event KMT-2018-BLG-1025. The analysis of the
light curve indicates that the anomaly is caused by a very low mass-ratio
companion to the lens. We identify three degenerate solutions, in which the
ambiguity between a pair of solutions (solutions B) is caused by the previously
known close--wide degeneracy, and the degeneracy between these and the other
solution (solution A) is a new type that has not been reported before. The
estimated mass ratio between the planet and host is $q\sim 0.8\times 10^{-4}$

(GP) spherical clouds to central Schwarzschild black holes and void evolution
with or without shocks. In order to grossly capture characteristic effects of
general relativity (GR) outside yet close to the event horizon of a
Schwarzschild black hole and to avoid mathematical complexity, we adopt the
approximation of the Paczynski-Wiita gravity to replace the simple Newtonian
gravity in our model formulation. A new dimensionless parameter s appears with
the physical meaning of the square of the ratio of the sound speed to the speed
of light $c$. Various self-similar dynamic solutions are constructed for a
polytropic index $\gamma>4/3$. Two (for small enough $s<1$) or no (for large
enough $s<1$) expansion-wave collapse solutions (EWCSs) with central event
horizons exist when $\gamma>4/3$, representing the collapse of static singular
GP spheres towards the central singularity of spacetime. Such GP spherical
dynamic mass collapse is shown to be highly efficient for the rapid formation
of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; mass range of $10^6-10^{10}M_{\odot}$) in
the early universe or even hypermassive black holes (HMBHs; mass range of
$10^{10}-10^{12}M_{\odot}$) if extremely massive mass reservoirs could be
sustained for a sufficiently long time, which may evolve into hard X-ray/gamma
ray sources or quasars according to their surroundings. Self-similar dynamic
solutions of a GP gas are also proposed for the stellar mass black hole
formation during the violent supernova explosion of a massive progenitor star,

of their counterparts a demanding task with uncertain results. New all-sky
multi-wavelength surveys of sufficient depth, like AllWISE and Gaia, and a new
Bayesian statistics based algorithm, NWAY, allow us, for the first time, to
provide reliable counterpart associations. NWAY extends previous distance and
sky density based association methods and, using one or more priors (e.g.,
colors, magnitudes), weights the probability that sources from two or more
catalogues are simultaneously associated on the basis of their observable
characteristics. Here, counterparts have been determined using a WISE
color-magnitude prior. A reference sample of 4524 XMM/Chandra and Swift X-ray
sources demonstrates a reliability of ~ 94.7% (2RXS) and 97.4% (XMMSL2).
Combining our results with Chandra-COSMOS data, we propose a new separation

orders of magnitude. We also release the NWAY code and its user manual. NWAY
was extensively tested with XMM-COSMOS data. Using two different sets of

inspection. With the advent of deep and wide area surveys in X-rays (e.g.

were performed from 2007 October to 2008 January. The campaign represents the
first contemporaneous data on the object at very high energy (VHE, E >100 GeV)
{\gamma}-ray, X-ray, and UV energies. Observations with VERITAS in VHE
{\gamma}-rays yield a strong detection of 20 {\sigma} with 633 excess events in
a total exposure of 18.1 hours live-time. A strong VHE {\gamma}-ray flare on
2007 December 7 is measured at F(>300 GeV) = (6.76 \pm 0.62) \times 10-11 ph
cm-2 s-1, corresponding to 48% of the Crab Nebula flux. Excluding this flaring
episode, nightly variability at lower fluxes is observed with a time-averaged
mean of F(>300 GeV) = (1.06 \pm 0.09) \times 10-11 ph cm-2 s-1 (7.6% of the
Crab Nebula flux). The differential photon spectrum between 390 GeV and 8.3 TeV
for the time-averaged observations excluding 2007 December 7 is well described
by a power law with a photon index of {\Gamma} = 2.78 \pm 0.09stat \pm
0.15syst. Over the full period of VERITAS observations contemporaneous X-ray
and UV data were taken with Swift and RXTE. The measured 2-10 keV flux ranged
by a factor of ~7 during the campaign. On 2007 December 8 the highest ever
observed X-ray flux from 1ES 2344+514 was measured by Swift XRT at a flux of
F(2-10 keV) = (6.28 \pm 0.31) \times 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1. Evidence for a
correlation between the X-ray flux and VHE {\gamma}-ray flux on nightly
time-scales is indicated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.60 \pm
0.11. Contemporaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 1ES 2344+514 are
presented for two distinct flux states. A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) model describes both SEDs using parameters consistent with previous SSC
modeling of 1ES 2344+514 from non-contemporaneous observations.","[{'name': 'V. A. Acciari'}, {'name': 'E. Aliu'}, {'name': 'T. Arlen'}, {'name': 'T. Aune'}, {'name': 'M. Beilicke'}, {'name': 'W.

  CRIRES+: Strong detections of CO, H$_2$O and Fe emission lines and a C$/$O
  consistent with solar","The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres has proven to be successful
using high-resolution spectroscopy. Phase curve observations of hot/ultra-hot
Jupiters can reveal their compositions and thermal structures, thereby allowing
the detection of molecules and atoms in the planetary atmosphere using the
cross-correlation technique. We present pre-eclipse observations of the
ultra-hot Jupiter, MASCARA-1b, observed with the recently upgraded CRIRES+
high-resolution infrared spectrograph at the VLT. We report a detection of $\rm
Fe$ ($\approx$8.3$\sigma$) in the K-band and confirm previous detections of
$\rm CO$ (>15$\sigma$) and $\rm H_2O$ (>10$\sigma$) in the day-side atmosphere
of MASCARA-1b. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we retrieve the abundances
of the detected species and constrain planetary orbital velocities, $T$-$P$
profiles, and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio ($\rm C/O$). A free retrieval results
in an elevated $\rm CO$ abundance ($\log_{10}$($\chi_{\rm{{}^{12}CO}}$) =
$-2.85^{+0.57}_{-0.69}$), leading to a super-solar $\rm C/O$ ratio. More
realistically, allowing for vertically-varying chemistry in the atmosphere by
incorporating a chemical-equilibrium model results in a $\rm C/O$ of
$0.68^{+0.12}_{-0.22}$ and a metallicity of $[\rm M/H] = 0.62^{+0.28}_{-0.55}$,
both consistent with solar values. Finally, we also report a slight offset of
the $\rm Fe$ feature in both K$_{\rm p}$ and v$_{\rm sys}$ that could be a
signature of atmospheric dynamics. Due to the 3D structure of exoplanet
atmospheres and the exclusion of time/phase dependence in our 1D forward
models, further follow-up observations and analysis are required to confirm or
refute this result.","[{'name': 'Swaetha Ramkumar'}, {'name': 'Neale P. Gibson'}, {'name': 'Stevanus K. Nugroho'}, {'name': 'Cathal Maguire'}, {'name': 'Mark Fortune'}]","21 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in Monthly
