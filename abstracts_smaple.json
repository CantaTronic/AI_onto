        "title": "Muon Track Reconstruction and Data Selection Techniques in AMANDA",
        "summary": "The Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) is a high-energy\nneutrino telescope operating at the geographic South Pole. It is a lattice of\nphoto-multiplier tubes buried deep in the polar ice between 1500m and 2000m.\nThe primary goal of this detector is to discover astrophysical sources of high\nenergy neutrinos. A high-energy muon neutrino coming through the earth from the\nNorthern Hemisphere can be identified by the secondary muon moving upward\nthrough the detector. The muon tracks are reconstructed with a maximum\nlikelihood method. It models the arrival times and amplitudes of Cherenkov\nphotons registered by the photo-multipliers. This paper describes the different\nmethods of reconstruction, which have been successfully implemented within\nAMANDA. Strategies for optimizing the reconstruction performance and rejecting\nbackground are presented. For a typical analysis procedure the direction of\ntracks are reconstructed with about 2 degree accuracy.",

        "title": "An update on the SCUBA-2 project",
        "summary": "SCUBA-2, which replaces SCUBA (the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array)\non the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in 2006, is a large-format\nbolometer array for submillimeter astronomy. Unlike previous detectors which\nhave used discrete bolometers, SCUBA-2 has two dc-coupled, monolithic, filled\narrays with a total of ~10,000 bolometers. It will offer simultaneous imaging\nof a 50 sq-arcmin field of view at wavelengths of 850 and 450 microns. SCUBA-2\nis expected to have a huge impact on the study of galaxy formation and\nevolution in the early Universe as well as star and planet formation in our own\nGalaxy. Mapping the sky to the same S/N up to 1000 times faster than SCUBA, it\nwill also act as a pathfinder for the new submillimeter interferometers such as\nALMA. SCUBA-2's absorber-coupled pixels use superconducting transition edge\nsensors operating at 120 mK for performance limited by the sky background\nphoton noise. The monolithic silicon detector arrays are deep-etched by the\nBosch process to isolate the pixels on silicon nitride membranes. Electrical\nconnections are made through indium bump bonds to a SQUID time-domain\nmultiplexer (MUX). We give an overview of the SCUBA-2 system and an update on\nits status, and describe some of the technological innovations that make this\nunique instrument possible.",

Its main objective is to detect\nand characterize other Earth-like planets, analyze the composition of their\natmospheres and their capability to sustain life, as we know it. DARWIN is\ncurrently in definition phase. This PhD work that has been undertaken within\nthe DARWIN team at the European Space Agency (ESA) addresses two crucial\naspects of the mission. Firstly, a DARWIN target star list has been established\nthat includes characteristics of the target star sample that will be critical\nfor final mission design, such as, luminosity, distance, spectral\nclassification, stellar variability, multiplicity, location and radius of the\nstar. Constrains were applied as set by planet evolution theory and mission\narchitecture. Secondly, a number of alternative mission architectures have been\nevaluated on the basis of interferometer response as a function of wavelength,\nachievable modulation efficiency, number of telescopes and starlight rejection\ncapabilities. The study has shown that the core mission goals should be\nachievable with a lower level of complexity as compared to the current baseline\nconfiguration.",

We then investigate whether the design of such a mission,\nspecifically the Darwin nulling interferometer, can be carried out in a\nsimplified scenario. The key element here is accepting somewhat higher levels\nof stellar leakage. We establish detailed requirements resulting from the\nscientific rationale for the mission, and calculate detailed parameters for the\nstellar suppression required to achieve those requirements. We do this\nutilizing the Darwin input catalogue. The dominating noise source for most\ntargets in this sample is essentially constant for all targets, while the\nleakage diminishes with the square of the distance. This means that the stellar\nleakage has an effect on the integration time only for the nearby stars, while\nfor the more distant targets its influence decreases significantly. We assess\nthe impact of different array configurations and nulling profiles and identify\nthe stars for which the detection efficiency can be maximized.",

        "summary": "CLOVER is an experiment which aims to detect the signature of gravitational\nwaves from inflation by measuring the B-mode polarization of the cosmic\nmicrowave background. CLOVER consists of three telescopes operating at 97, 150,\nand 220 GHz. The 97-GHz telescope has 160 horns in its focal plane while the\n150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 256 horns each. The horns are arranged in a\nhexagonal array and feed a polarimeter which uses finline-coupled TES\nbolometers as detectors. To detect the two polarizations the 97-GHz telescope\nhas 320 detectors while the 150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 512 detectors each.\nTo achieve the required NEPs the detectors are cooled to 100 mK for the 97 and\n150-GHz polarimeters and 230 mK for the 220-GHz polarimeter. Each detector is\nfabricated as a single chip to guarantee fully functioning focal planes. The\ndetectors are contained in linear modules made of copper which form split-block\nwaveguides. The detector modules contain 16 or 20 detectors each for\ncompatibility with the hexagonal arrays of horns in the telescopes' focal\nplanes. Each detector module contains a time-division SQUID multiplexer to read\nout the detectors. Further amplification of the multiplexed signals is provided\nby SQUID series arrays. The first prototype detectors for CLOVER operate with a\nbath temperature of 230 mK and are used to validate the detector design as well\nas the polarimeter technology. We describe the design of the CLOVER detectors,\ndetector blocks, and readout, and give an update on the detector development.",

These calculations are\ndesigned to guide the interpretation of an observed spectrum of such a planet\nby future instruments that will characterize exoplanets. Our models focus on\nspectral features that either imply habitability or are required for\nhabitability. These features are generated by H2O, CO2, CH4, O2, O3, N2O, and\nvegetation-like surface albedos. We chose six geological epochs to\ncharacterize. These epochs exhibit a wide range in abundance for these\nmolecules, ranging from a CO2 rich early atmosphere, to a CO2/CH4-rich\natmosphere around 2 billion years ago to a present-day atmosphere. We analyzed\nthe spectra to quantify the strength of each important spectral feature in both\nthe visible and thermal infrared spectral regions, and the resolutions required\nto unambiguously observe the features for each epoch. We find a wide range of\nspectral resolutions required for observing the different features. For\nexample, H2O and O3 can be observed with relatively low resolution, while O2\nand N2O require higher resolution. We also find that the inclusion of clouds in\nour models significantly affects both the strengths and resolutions required to\nobserve all spectral features.",

        "summary": "Identifying frequencies with low signal-to-noise ratios in time series of\nstellar photometry and spectroscopy, and measuring their amplitude ratios and\npeak widths accurately, are critical goals for asteroseismology. These are also\nchallenges for time series with gaps or whose data are not sampled at a\nconstant rate, even with modern Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) software. Also\nthe False-Alarm Probability introduced by Lomb and Scargle is an approximation\nwhich becomes less reliable in time series with longer data gaps. A rigorous\nstatistical treatment of how to determine the significance of a peak in a DFT,\ncalled SigSpec, is presented here. SigSpec is based on an analytical solution\nof the probability that a DFT peak of a given amplitude does not arise from\nwhite noise in a non-equally spaced data set. The underlying Probability\nDensity Function (PDF) of the amplitude spectrum generated by white noise can\nbe derived explicitly if both frequency and phase are incorporated into the\nsolution. In this paper, I define and evaluate an unbiased statistical\nestimator, the \"spectral significance\", which depends on frequency, amplitude,\nand phase in the DFT, and which takes into account the time-domain sampling. I\nalso compare this estimator to results from other well established techniques\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of SigSpec with a few examples of ground- and\nspace-based photometric data, illustratring how SigSpec deals with the effects\nof noise and time-domain sampling in determining significant frequencies.",

        "summary": "It has long been suggested that helium nuclei in the intracluster plasma can\nsediment in the cluster gravitational potential well. Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach. We also briefly discuss how the SZ and\nX-ray cluster data can be combined to resolve the helium abundance dependence\nfor the d_a(z) cosmological test.",

They concluded that the\nlarge amount of O2 and the simultaneous presence of CH4 traces are strongly\nsuggestive of biology. The detection of a widespread red-absorbing pigment with\nno likely mineral origin supports the hypothesis of biophotosynthesis. The\nsearch for signs of life on possibly very different planets implies that we\nneed to gather as much information as possible in order to understand how the\nobserved atmosphere physically and chemically works.\n  The Earth-Sun intensity ratio is about 10^{-7} in the thermal infrared (10\nmicrometer), and about 10^{-10} in the visible (0.5 micrometer). The\ninterferometric systems suggested for Darwin and the Terrestrial Planet Finder\nInterferometer (TPF-I) mission operates in the mid-IR (5 - 20 micrometer), the\ncoronagraph suggested for Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph (TPF-C) in the\nvisible (0.5 - 1 micrometer). For the former it is thus the thermal emission\nemanating from the planet that is detected and analyzed while for the later the\nreflected stellar flux is measured. The spectrum of the planet can contain\nsignatures of atmospheric species that are important for habitability, like CO2\nand H2O, or result from biological activity (O2, O3, CH4, and N2O). Both\nspectral regions contain atmospheric bio-indicators. The presence or absence of\nthese spectral features will indicate similarities or differences with the\natmospheres of terrestrial planets and are discussed in detail and set into\ncontext with the physical characteristics of a planet in this chapter.",

        "title": "Signal-to-noise ratio of phase sensing telescope interferometers",
        "summary": "This paper is the third part of a trilogy dealing with the principles,\nperformance and limitations of what I named \"Telescope-Interferometers\" (TIs).\nThe basic idea consists in transforming one telescope into a Wavefront Error\n(WFE) sensing device. This can be achieved in two different ways, namely the\noff axis and phase-shifting TIs. In both cases the Point-Spread Function (PSF)\nmeasured in the focal plane of the telescope carries information about the\ntransmitted WFE, which is retrieved by fast and simple algorithms suitable to\nan Adaptive Optics (AO) regime. Herein are evaluated the uncertainties of both\ntypes of TIs, in terms of noise and systematic errors. Numerical models are\ndeveloped in order to establish the dependence of driving parameters such as\nuseful spectral range, angular size of the observed star, or detector noise on\nthe total WFE measurement error. The latter is found particularly sensitive to\nphoton noise, which rapidly governs the achieved accuracy for telescope\ndiameters higher than 10 m. We study a few practical examples, showing that TI\nmethod is applicable to AO systems on telescope diameters ranging from 10 to 50\nm, depending on seeing conditions and magnitude of the observed stars. We also\ndiscuss the case of a space-borne coronagraph where TI technique provides high\nsampling of the input WFE map.",

        "summary": "Herein is discussed the performance of spaceborne nulling interferometers\nsearching for extra-solar planets, in terms of their extinction maps projected\non-sky. In particular, it is shown that the designs of Spatial Filtering (SF)\nand Achromatic Phase Shifter (APS) subsystems, both required to achieve planet\ndetection and characterization, can sensibly affect the nulling maps produced\nby a simple Bracewell interferometer. Analytical relationships involving cross\ncorrelation products are provided and numerical simulations are performed,\ndemonstrating marked differences in the aspect of extinction maps and the\nvalues of attained fringes contrasts. It is concluded that depending on their\nbasic principles and designs, FS and APS will result in variable capacities for\nserendipitous discoveries of planets orbiting around their parent star. The\nmathematical relationships presented in this paper are assumed to be general,\ni.e. they should apply to other types of multi-apertures nulling\ninterferometers.",

As such, it maps out\nover a 15-year horizon the techniques and capabilities required to detect and\nmeasure the properties of planets as small as Earth around stars as large as\nour own Sun. It shows how the technology pieces and their development fit\ntogether to achieve the primary goal of the strategy: if planets like Earth\nexist around stars within some tens of light years of our own Solar System,\nthose planets will be found and their basic properties characterized. Essential\nto this strategy is not only the search for and examination of individual\nplanets, but also a knowledge of the arrangement, or architecture, of planetary\nsystems around as large a number of stars as possible; this is the second goal\nof the strategy. The final goal of the strategy is the study of disks around\nstars, important both to understand the implications of the variety of\nexoplanet systems for planet formation, and to determine how many nearby stars\nhave environments around them clean enough of debris that planets may be sought\nand, if found, characterized.",

        "summary": "Several types of Wavefront Sensors (WFS) are nowadays available in the field\nof Adaptive Optics (AO). Generally speaking, their basic principle consists in\nmeasuring slopes or curvatures of Wavefront Errors (WFE) transmitted by a\ntelescope, subsequently reconstructing WFEs digitally. Such process, however,\ndoes not seem to be well suited for evaluating co-phasing or piston errors of\nfuture large segmented telescopes in quasi real-time. This communication\npresents an original, recently proposed technique for direct WFE sensing. The\nprinciple of the device, which is named \"Telescope-Interferometer\" (TI), is\nbased on the addition of a reference optical arm into the telescope pupil\nplane. Then incident WFEs are deduced from Point Spread Function (PSF)\nmeasurements at the telescope focal plane. Herein are described two different\ntypes of TIs, and their performance are discussed in terms of intrinsic\nmeasurement accuracy and spatial resolution. Various error sources are studied\nby means of numerical simulations, among which photon noise sounds the most\ncritical. Those computations finally help to define the application range of\nthe TI method in an AO regime, including main and auxiliary telescope diameters\nand magnitude of the guide star. Some practical examples of optical\nconfigurations are also described and commented.",

On the land, vegetation reflects\nin the visible, leading to a red edge that developed about 450 Myr ago and has\nbeen proposed as a biosignature for life on extrasolar planets. However, in\nmany regions of the Earth, and particularly where surface conditions are\nextreme, for example in hot and cold deserts, photosynthetic organisms can be\ndriven into and under substrates where light is still sufficient for\nphotosynthesis. These communities exhibit no detectable surface spectral\nsignature to indicate life. The same is true of the assemblages of\nphotosynthetic organisms at more than a few metres depth in water bodies. These\ncommunities are widespread and dominate local photosynthetic productivity. We\nreview known cryptic photosynthetic communities and their productivity. We link\ngeomicrobiology with observational astronomy by calculating the disk-averaged\nspectra of cryptic habitats and identifying detectable features on an exoplanet\ndominated by such a biota. The hypothetical cryptic photosynthesis worlds\ndiscussed here are Earth-analogs that show detectable atmospheric biomarkers\nlike our own planet, but do not exhibit a discernable biological surface\nfeature in the disc-averaged spectrum.",

In this paper we\ndevelop a variation of the direct imaging correlator we call the MOFF\ncorrelator. The MOFF correlator shares the computational advantages of a direct\nimaging correlator, while avoiding a number of its shortcomings. In particular\nthe MOFF correlator makes no constraints on the antenna arrangement or type,\nprovides a fully calibrated output image including widefield polarimetry and\nnon-coplanar baseline effects, and can be orders-of-magnitude more efficient\nthan XF or FX correlators for compact radio cosmology arrays.",

        "summary": "The use of conventional neutrino telescope methods and technology for\ndetecting neutrinos with energies above 1 EeV from astrophysical sources would\nbe prohibitively expensive and may turn out to be technically not feasible.\nAcoustic detection is a promising alternative for future deep-sea neutrino\ntelescopes operating in this energy regime. It utilises the effect that the\nenergy deposit of the particle cascade evolving from a neutrino interaction in\nwater generates a coherently emitted sound wave with frequency components in\nthe range between about 1 and 50 kHz. The AMADEUS (Antares Modules for Acoustic\nDEtection Under the Sea) project is integrated into the ANTARES neutrino\ntelescope and aims at the investigation of techniques for acoustic particle\ndetection in sea water. The acoustic sensors of AMADEUS are using piezo\nelements and are recording a broad-band signal with frequencies ranging up to\n125 kHz. After an introduction to acoustic neutrino detection it will be shown\nhow an acoustic array similar to AMADEUS can be used for positioning as well as\nacoustic particle detection. Experience from AMADEUS and possibilities for a\nfuture large scale neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea will be\ndiscussed.",

        "summary": "The AMADEUS system is integrated in the ANTARES neutrino telescope in the\nMediterranean Sea and aims for the investigation of acoustic particle detection\ntechniques in the deep sea. Installed at a depth of more than 2000m, the\nacoustic sensors of AMADEUS are using piezo-ceramic elements for the broad-band\nrecording of acoustic signals with frequencies ranging up to 125kHz. AMADEUS\nconsists of six clusters, each one comprising six acoustic sensors that are\narranged at distances of roughly 1m from each other. Three acoustic clusters\nare installed along a vertical mechanical structure (a so-called Line) of\nANTARES with spacings of about 15m and 110m, respectively. The remaining 3\nclusters are installed with vertical spacings of 15m on a further Line of the\nANTARES detector. The horizontal distance between the two lines is 240m. Each\nacoustic cluster allows for the suppression of random noise by requiring local\ncoincidences and the reconstruction of the arrival direction of acoustic waves.\nSource positions can then be reconstructed using the precise time correlations\nbetween the clusters provided by the ANTARES clock system. AMADEUS thus allows\nfor extensive acoustic background studies including signal correlations on\nseveral length scales as well as source localisation. The system is therefore\nexcellently suited for feasibility studies for a potential future large scale\nacoustic neutrino telescope in sea water. Since the start of data taking on\nDecember 5th, 2007 a wealth of data has been recorded. The AMADEUS system will\nbe described and some first results will be presented.",

Because it does not have imaging\ncapability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity is\nlimited by the reproducibility of the non X-ray background (NXB) model. We\nmodeled the HXD NXB, which varies with time as well as other satellites with a\nlow-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitor\ncounts and satellite orbital/attitude information. The model background is\nsupplied as an event file in which the background events are generated by\nrandom numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. The\nreproducibility of the NXB model depends on the event selection criteria (such\nas cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigma\nsystematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (PIN 15--40 keV) and 1% (GSO\n50--100 keV) for more than 10 ksec exposure.",

The second is PModel, a plugin\nfor the Interactive Spectral Interpretation System (ISIS) which allows\narbitrary components of a broad range of astrophysical models to be distributed\nacross processors during fitting and confidence limits calculations, by\nscientists with little training in parallel programming. Plugging the XSTAR\nfamily of analytic models into PModel enables multiple ionization states (e.g.,\nof a complex absorber/emitter) to be computed simultaneously, alleviating the\noften prohibitive expense of the traditional serial approach. Initial\nperformance results indicate that these methods substantially enlarge the\nproblem space to which XSTAR may be applied within practical timeframes.",

        "summary": "One important frontier for astronomical adaptive optics (AO) involves methods\nsuch as Multi-Object AO and Multi-Conjugate AO that have the potential to give\na significantly larger field of view than conventional AO techniques. A second\nkey emphasis over the next decade will be to push astronomical AO to visible\nwavelengths. We have conducted the first laboratory simulations of wide-field,\nlaser guide star adaptive optics at visible wavelengths on a 10-meter-class\ntelescope. These experiments, utilizing the UCO/Lick Observatory's Multi-Object\n/ Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics (MOAO/LTAO) testbed, demonstrate new\ntechniques in wavefront sensing and control that are crucial to future on-sky\nMOAO systems. We (1) test and confirm the feasibility of highly accurate\natmospheric tomography with laser guide stars, (2) demonstrate key innovations\nallowing open-loop operation of Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors (with errors\nof ~30 nm) as will be needed for MOAO, and (3) build a complete error budget\nmodel describing system performance. The AO system maintains a performance of\n32.4% Strehl on-axis, with 24.5% and 22.6% at 10\" and 15\", respectively, at a\nscience wavelength of 710 nm (R-band) over the equivalent of 0.8 seconds of\nsimulation. The MOAO-corrected field of view is ~25 times larger in area than\nthat limited by anisoplanatism at R-band. Our error budget is composed of terms\nverified through independent, empirical experiments. Error terms arising from\ncalibration inaccuracies and optical drift are comparable in magnitude to\ntraditional terms like fitting error and tomographic error. This makes a strong\ncase for implementing additional calibration facilities in future AO systems,\nincluding accelerometers on powered optics, 3D turbulators, telescope and LGS\nsimulators, and external calibration ports for deformable mirrors.",

New opportunities\nare offered by coherent single mode fibers, whose technological development has\nbeen motivated by the needs of the telecom industry in the near infrared. This\npaper presents a new vision for an instrument using coherent waveguides to\nremap the pupil geometry of the telescope. It would (i) inject the full pupil\nof the telescope into an array of single mode fibers, (ii) rearrange the pupil\nso fringes can be accurately measured, and (iii) permit image reconstruction so\nthat atmospheric blurring can be totally removed. Here we present a laboratory\nexperiment whose goal was to validate the theoretical concepts underpinning our\nproposed method.

        "summary": "We develop a numerical solver for the integral-differential equations, which\ndescribes the radiative transfer of photon distribution in the frequency space\nwith resonant scattering of Lyalpha photons by hydrogen gas in the early\nuniverse. The time-dependent solutions of this equation is crucial to the\nestimation of the effect of the Wouthuysen-Field (WF) coupling in relation to\nthe 21 cm emission and absorption at the epoch of reionization. The resonant\nscattering leads to the photon distribution in the frequency space to be\npiecewise smooth containing sharp changes. The weighted essentially\nnonoscillatory (WENO) scheme is suitable to handle this problem, as this\nalgorithm has been found to be highly stable and robust for solving Boltzmann\nequation. We test this numerical solver against analytic solutions of the\nevolution of the photon distribution in rest background, analytic solution in\nexpanding background without resonant scattering and formation of local\nBoltzmann distribution around the resonant frequency with the temperature same\nas that of atom for recoil. We find that evolution of photon distribution\nundergoes three phases; profile is similar to the initial one, a flat plateau\n(without recoil) or local Boltzmann distribution (with recoil) forms around the\nresonant frequency, and finally the distribution around the resonant frequency\nis saturated when the photons from the source is balanced by the redshift of\nthe expansion. This result indicates that the onset of the W-F coupling should\nnot be determined by the third phase, but by the time scale of the second\nphase. We found that the time scale of the W-F coupling is equal to about a few\nhundreds of the mean free flight time of photons with resonant frequency, and\nis independent of the Sobolev parameter if this parameter is much less than 1.",

        "title": "PCA Tomography: how to extract information from datacubes",
        "summary": "Astronomy has evolved almost exclusively by the use of spectroscopic and\nimaging techniques, operated separately. With the development of modern\ntechnologies it is possible to obtain datacubes in which one combines both\ntechniques simultaneously, producing images with spectral resolution. To\nextract information from them can be quite complex, and hence the development\nof new methods of data analysis is desirable. We present a method of analysis\nof datacube (data from single field observations, containing two spatial and\none spectral dimension) that uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to express\nthe data in the form of reduced dimensionality, facilitating efficient\ninformation extraction from very large data sets. PCA transforms the system of\ncorrelated coordinates into a system of uncorrelated coordinates ordered by\nprincipal components of decreasing variance. The new coordinates are referred\nto as eigenvectors, and the projections of the data onto these coordinates\nproduce images we will call tomograms. The association of the tomograms\n(images) to eigenvectors (spectra) is important for the interpretation of both.\nThe eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal and this information is fundamental\nfor their handling and interpretation. When the datacube shows objects that\npresent uncorrelated physical phenomena, the eigenvector's orthogonality may be\ninstrumental in separating and identifying them. By handling eigenvectors and\ntomograms one can enhance features, extract noise, compress data, extract\nspectra, etc. We applied the method, for illustration purpose only, to the\ncentral region of the LINER galaxy NGC 4736, and demonstrate that it has a type\n1 active nucleus, not known before. Furthermore we show that it is displaced\nfrom the centre of its stellar bulge.",

        "title": "Optimization of mapping modes for heterodyne instruments",
        "summary": "Astronomic line mapping with single-pixel instruments is usually performed in\nan on-the-fly (OTF) or a raster-mapping mode depending on the capabilities of\nthe telescope and the instrument. The observing efficiency can be increased by\ncombining several source-point integrations with a common reference\nmeasurement. This is implemented at many telescopes, but a thorough\ninvestigation of the optimum calibration of the modes and the best way of\nperforming these observations is still lacking.\n  We use knowledge of the instrumental stability obtained by an Allan variance\nmeasurement to derive a mathematical formalism for optimizing the setup of\nmapping observations. Special attention has to be paid to minimizing of the\nimpact of correlated noise introduced by the common OFF integrations and to the\ncorrection of instrumental drifts. Both aspects can be covered using a\ncalibration scheme that interpolates between two OFF measurements and an\nappropriate OFF integration time.\n  The total uncertainty of the calibrated data consisting of radiometric noise\nand drift noise can be minimized by adjusting the source integration time and\nthe number of data points observed between two OFF measurements. It turns out\nthat OTF observations are very robust. They provide a low relative noise, even\nif their setup deviates considerably from the optimum. Fast data readouts are\noften essential to minimize the drift contributions. In particular, continuum\nmeasurements may be easily spoiled by instrumental drifts. The main drawback of\nthe described mapping modes is the limited use of the measured data at\ndifferent spatial or spectroscopic resolutions obtained by additional\nrebinning.",

        "summary": "We present a filtering technique that can be applied to individual baselines\nof wide-bandwidth, wide-field interferometric data to geometrically select\nregions on the celestial sphere that contain primary calibration sources. The\ntechnique relies on the Fourier transformation of wide-band frequency spectra\nfrom a given baseline to obtain one-dimensional \"delay images\", and then the\ntransformation of a time-series of delay images to obtain two-dimensional\n\"delay/delay-rate images.\" Source selection is possible in these images given\nappropriate combinations of baseline, bandwidth, integration time and source\nlocation. Strong and persistent radio frequency interference (RFI) limits the\neffectiveness of this source selection owing to the removal of data by RFI\nexcision algorithms. A one-dimensional, complex CLEAN algorithm has been\ndeveloped to compensate for RFI-excision effects. This approach allows CLEANed,\nsource-isolated data to be used to isolate bandpass and primary beam gain\nfunctions. These techniques are applied to data from the Precision Array for\nProbing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) as a demonstration of their value in\ncalibrating a new generation of low-frequency radio interferometers with wide\nrelative bandwidths and large fields-of-view.",

        "summary": "The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a common tool in the frequency analysis of\nunequally spaced data equivalent to least-squares fitting of sine waves. We\ngive an analytic solution for the generalisation to a full sine wave fit,\nincluding an offset and weights ($\\chi^{2}$ fitting). Compared to the\nLomb-Scargle periodogram, the generalisation is superior as it provides more\naccurate frequencies, is less susceptible to aliasing, and gives a much better\ndetermination of the spectral intensity. Only a few modifications are required\nfor the computation and the computational effort is similar. Our approach\nbrings together several related methods that can be found in the literature,\nviz. the date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, the floating-mean\nperiodogram, and the \"spectral significance\" estimator used in the SigSpec\nprogram, for which we point out some equivalences. Furthermore, we present an\nalgorithm that implements this generalisation for the evaluation of the\nKeplerian periodogram that searches for the period of the best-fitting\nKeplerian orbit to radial velocity data. The systematic and non-random\nalgorithm is capable of detecting eccentric orbits, which is demonstrated by\ntwo examples and can be a useful tool in searches for the orbital periods of\nexoplanets.",

It will provide full-disk maps (4096$\\times$4096\npixels) of the magnetic field vector on the Solar Photosphere every 10 minutes.\nFor this reason VFISV is optimized to achieve an inversion speed that will\nallow it to invert 16 million pixels every 10 minutes with a modest number\n(approx. 50) of CPUs. Here we focus on describing a number of important\ndetails, simplifications and tweaks that have allowed us to significantly speed\nup the inversion process.

Optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR) was used to recover tables from 740 papers. Tables\nfrom only 41 percent of the 2600 articles are available in the CDS or CATS\ncatalog collections, and only slightly better coverage is estimated for the NED\ndatabase. This fraction is not better for articles published electronically\nsince 2001. Both object databases (NED, SIMBAD, LEDA) as well as catalog\nbrowsers (VizieR, CATS) need to be consulted to obtain the most complete\ninformation on astronomical objects. More human resources at the data centers\nand better collaboration between authors, referees, editors, publishers, and\ndata centers are required to improve data coverage and accessibility. The\ncurrent efforts within the Virtual Observatory (VO) project, to provide\nretrieval and analysis tools for different types of published and archival data\nstored at various sites, should be balanced by an equal effort to recover and\ninclude large amounts of published data not currently available in this way.",

        "title": "Digital Signal Processing in Cosmology",
        "summary": "We address the problem of discretizing continuous cosmological signals such\nas a galaxy distribution for further processing with Fast Fourier techniques.\nDiscretizing, in particular representing continuous signals by discrete sets of\nsample points, introduces an enormous loss of information, which has to be\nunderstood in detail if one wants to make inference from the discretely sampled\nsignal towards actual natural physical quantities. We therefore review the\nmathematics of discretizing signals and the application of Fast Fourier\nTransforms to demonstrate how the interpretation of the processed data can be\naffected by these procedures. It is also a well known fact that any practical\nsampling method introduces sampling artifacts and false information in the form\nof aliasing. These sampling artifacts, especially aliasing, make further\nprocessing of the sampled signal difficult. For this reason we introduce a fast\nand efficient supersampling method, frequently applied in 3D computer graphics,\nto cosmological applications such as matter power spectrum estimation. This\nmethod consists of two filtering steps which allow for a much better\napproximation of the ideal sampling procedure, while at the same time being\ncomputationally very efficient.Thus, it provides discretely sampled signals\nwhich are greately cleaned from aliasing contributions.",

Current methods for identifying events require a\nsliding window of a fixed size, which is not ideal for all applications and\ncould overlook important events. In this work, we develop probability models\nfor calculating the significance of an arbitrary-sized sliding window and use\nthese probabilities to find areas of significance. Because a brute force search\nof all sliding windows and all window sizes would be computationally\nintractable, we introduce a method for quickly approximating the results. We\napply our method to over 100,000 astronomical time series from the MACHO\nsurvey, in which 56 different sections of the sky are considered, each with one\nor more known events. Our method was able to recover 100% of these events in\nthe top 1% of the results, essentially pruning 99% of the data. Interestingly,\nour method was able to identify events that do not pass traditional event\ndiscovery procedures.",

        "summary": "A number of experiments are set to measure the 21-cm signal of neutral\nhydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The common denominator of these\nexperiments are the large data sets produced, contaminated by various\ninstrumental effects, ionospheric distortions, RFI and strong Galactic and\nextragalactic foregrounds. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the\nData Model that will be the basis of the signal analysis for the LOFAR (Low\nFrequency Array) EoR Key Science Project (LOFAR EoR KSP). Using this data model\nwe simulate realistic visibility data sets over a wide frequency band, taking\nproperly into account all currently known instrumental corruptions (e.g.\ndirection-dependent gains, complex gains, polarization effects, noise, etc). We\nthen apply primary calibration errors to the data in a statistical sense,\nassuming that the calibration errors are random Gaussian variates at a level\nconsistent with our current knowledge based on observations with the LOFAR Core\nStation 1. Our aim is to demonstrate how the systematics of an interferometric\nmeasurement affect the quality of the calibrated data, how errors correlate and\npropagate, and in the long run how this can lead to new calibration strategies.\nWe present results of these simulations and the inversion process and\nextraction procedure. We also discuss some general properties of the coherency\nmatrix and Jones formalism that might prove useful in solving the calibration\nproblem of aperture synthesis arrays. We conclude that even in the presence of\nrealistic noise and instrumental errors, the statistical signature of the EoR\nsignal can be detected by LOFAR with relatively small errors. A detailed study\nof the statistical properties of our data model and more complex instrumental\nmodels will be considered in the future.",

        "summary": "Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) represents a powerful technique for the\ndetection and characterization of extrasolar planets through high contrast\nimaging, since it allows to obtain simultaneously a large number of\nmonochromatic images. These can be used to calibrate and then to reduce the\nimpact of speckles, once their chromatic dependence is taken into account. The\nmain concern in designing integral field spectrographs for high contrast\nimaging is the impact of the diffraction effects and the non-common path\naberrations together with an efficient use of the detector pixels. We focus our\nattention on integral field spectrographs based on lenslet-arrays, discussing\nthe main features of these designs: the conditions of appropriate spatial and\nspectral sampling of the resulting spectrograph's slit functions and their\nrelated cross-talk terms when the system works at the diffraction limit. We\npresent a new scheme for the integral field unit (IFU) based on a dual-lenslet\ndevice (BIGRE), that solves some of the problems related to the classical TIGER\ndesign when used for such applications. We show that BIGRE provides much lower\ncross-talk signals than TIGER, allowing a more efficient use of the detector\npixels and a considerable saving of the overall cost of a lenslet-based\nintegral field spectrograph.",

        "title": "Optimal PSF modeling for weak lensing: complexity and sparsity",
        "summary": "We investigate the impact of point spread function (PSF) fitting errors on\ncosmic shear measurements using the concepts of complexity and sparsity.\nComplexity, introduced in a previous paper, characterizes the number of degrees\nof freedom of the PSF. For instance, fitting an underlying PSF with a model\nwith low complexity will lead to small statistical errors on the model\nparameters, however these parameters could suffer from large biases.\nAlternatively, fitting with a large number of parameters will tend to reduce\nbiases at the expense of statistical errors. We perform an optimisation of\nscatters and biases by studying the mean squared error of a PSF model. We also\ncharacterize a model sparsity, which describes how efficiently the model is\nable to represent the underlying PSF using a limited number of free parameters.\nWe present the general case and illustrate it for a realistic example of PSF\nfitted with shapelet basis sets. We derive the relation between complexity and\nsparsity of the PSF model, signal-to-noise ratio of stars and systematic errors\non cosmological parameters. With the constraint of maintaining the systematics\nbelow the statistical uncertainties, this lead to a relation between the\nrequired number of stars to calibrate the PSF and the sparsity. We discuss the\nimpact of our results for current and future cosmic shear surveys. In the\ntypical case where the biases can be represented as a power law of the\ncomplexity, we show that current weak lensing surveys can calibrate the PSF\nwith few stars, while future surveys will require hard constraints on the\nsparsity in order to calibrate the PSF with 50 stars.",

Potential sources include core\ncollapse supernovae, gamma ray burst progenitors, and mergers of binary black\nholes or neutron stars. We present a density-based clustering algorithm to\nimprove the performance of time-frequency searches for such gravitational-wave\nbursts when they are extended in time and/or frequency, and not sufficiently\nwell known to permit matched filtering. We have implemented this algorithm as\nan extension to the QPipeline, a gravitational-wave data analysis pipeline for\nthe detection of bursts, which currently determines the statistical\nsignificance of events based solely on the peak significance observed in\nminimum uncertainty regions of the time-frequency plane. Density based\nclustering improves the performance of such a search by considering the\naggregate significance of arbitrarily shaped regions in the time-frequency\nplane and rejecting the isolated minimum uncertainty features expected from the\nbackground detector noise. In this paper, we present test results for simulated\nsignals and demonstrate that density based clustering improves the performance\nof the QPipeline for signals extended in time and/or frequency.",

        "summary": "The second XMM-Newton serendipitous source catalogue, 2XMM, provides the\nideal data base for performing a statistical evaluation of the flux\ncross-calibration of the XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC). We\naim to evaluate the status of the relative flux calibration of the EPIC cameras\non board XMM-Newton (MOS1, MOS2, and pn) and investigate the dependence of the\ncalibration on energy, position in the field of view of the X-ray detectors,\nand lifetime of the mission. We compiled the distribution of flux percentage\ndifferences for large samples of 'good quality' objects detected with at least\ntwo of the EPIC cameras. The mean offset of the fluxes and dispersion of the\ndistributions was then found by Gaussian fitting. Count rate to flux conversion\nwas performed with a fixed spectral model. The impact on the results of varying\nthis model was investigated. Excellent agreement was found between the two EPIC\nMOS cameras to better than 4% from 0.2 keV to 12.0 keV. MOS cameras register\n7-9% higher flux than pn below 4.5 keV and 10-13% flux excess above 4.5 keV. No\nevolution of the flux ratios is seen with time, except at energies below 0.5\nkeV, where we found a strong decrease in the MOS to pn flux ratio with time.\nThis effect is known to be due to a gradually degrading MOS redistribution\nfunction. The flux ratios show some dependence on distance from the optical\naxis in the sense that the MOS to pn flux excess increases with off-axis angle.\nFurthermore, in the 4.5-12.0 keV band there is a strong dependence of the MOS\nto pn excess flux on the azimuthal-angle. These results strongly suggest that\nthe calibration of the Reflection Grating Array (RGA) blocking factors is\nincorrect at high energies. Finally, we recommend ways to improve the\ncalculation of fluxes in future versions of XMM-Newton source catalogues.",

        "summary": "Context: The technique of disentangling has been applied to numerous\nhigh-precision studies of spectroscopic binaries and multiple stars. Although,\nits possibilities have not yet been fully understood and exploited. Aims:\nTheoretical background aspects of the method, its latest improvements and hints\nfor its use in practice are explained in this series of papers. Methods: In\nthis first paper of the series, we discuss spectral-resolution limitations due\nto a discrete representation of the observed spectra and introduce a new method\nhow to achieve a precision higher than the step of input-data binning. Results:\nBased on this principle, the latest version of the KOREL code for Fourier\ndisentangling achieves an increase in precision for an order of magnitude.",

        "summary": "Most observational techniques in astronomy can be understood as exploiting\nthe various forms of the first-order correlation function g^(1). As however\ndemonstrated by the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer back in the\n1960's by Hanbury Brown & Twiss, and which is the first experiment to measure\nthe second-order correlation function g^(2), light can carry more information\nthan simply its intensity, spectrum and polarization. Since this experiment,\ntheoretical and laboratory studies of non-classical properties of light have\nbecome a very active field of research, namely quantum optics. Despite the\nvariety of results in this field, astrophysics remained focused essentially on\nfirst-order coherence. In this paper, we study the possibility that quantum\nproperties of light could be observed in cosmic sources. We provide the basic\nmathematical ingredients about the first and the second order correlation\nfunctions, applied to the modern context of astronomical observations. The\nexploitation of g^(2) is certainly richer than what a modern intensity\ninterferometer could bring and is particularly interesting for sources of\nnon-thermal light. We conclude by briefly presenting why microquasars in our\ngalaxy and their extragalactic parents can represent an excellent first target\nin the optical/near-infrared where to observe non-thermal light, and test the\nuse of g^(2) in astrophysical sources.",

        "summary": "The study of the linear and circular polarization in AGN allows one to gain\ndetailed information about the properties of the magnetic fields in these\nobjects. However, especially the observation of circular polarization (CP) with\nsingle-dish radio-telescopes is usually difficult because of the weak signals\nto be expected. Normally CP is derived as the (small) difference of two large\nnumbers (LHC and RHC); hence an accurate calibration is absolutely necessary.\nOur aim is to improve the calibration accuracy to include the Stokes parameter\nV in the common single-dish polarimetric measurements, allowing a full Stokes\nstudy of the source under examination. A detailed study, up to the 2nd order,\nof the Mueller matrix elements in terms of cross-talk components allows us to\nreach the accuracy necessary to study circular polarization. The new\ncalibration method has been applied to data taken at the 100-m Effelsberg\nradio-telescope during regular test observations of extragalactic sources at\n2.8, 3.6, 6 and 11 cm. The D-terms in phase and amplitude appear very stable\nwith time and the few known values of circular polarization have been\nconfirmed. It is shown that, whenever a classical receiver and a multiplying\npolarimeter are available, the proposed calibration scheme allows one to\ninclude Stokes V in standard single-dish polarimetric observations as\ndifference of two native circular outputs.",

        "summary": "We propose easy ways of correcting for the systematic errors caused by the\nphoton noise and the pixelation effect in cosmic shear measurements. Our\ntreatment of noise can reliably remove the noise contamination to the cosmic\nshear even when the flux density of the noise is comparable with those of the\nsources. For pixelated images, we find that one can accurately reconstruct\ntheir corresponding continuous images by interpolating the logarithms of the\npixel readouts with either the Bicubic or the Bicubic Spline method. The cosmic\nshears measured from the interpolated continuous images contain negligible\nsystematic errors as long as the pixel size is about less than the scale size\nof the point spread function (PSF, including the pixel response function), a\ncondition which is almost always satisfied in practice. Our methodology is well\ndefined regardless of the morphologies of the galaxies and the PSF. Despite\nthat our discussion is based on the shear measurement method of Zhang (2008),\nour way of treating the noise can in principle be considered in other methods,\nand the interpolation method that we introduce for reconstructing continuous\nimages from pixelated ones is generally useful for digital image processing of\nall purposes.",

        "summary": "The IceCube detector allows for the first time a measurement of atmospheric\nmuon and neutrino energy spectra from tens of GeV up to the PeV range. The\nlepton flux in the highest energy region depends on both the primary cosmic ray\ncomposition around the \"knee\" and the contribution from prompt decays of mostly\ncharmed hadrons produced in air showers. It is demonstrated here that a direct\nmeasurement of the atmospheric muon spectrum in the region above 100 TeV is\nfeasible using data that is already available.",

In this paper we extend the analysis to the\nmagnetic component of the scalar mode of GWs which arise from scalar-tensor\ngravity theory. In the low-frequency approximation, the response function of\nground-based interferometers is calculated. The angular dependence of the\nelectric and magnetic contributions to the response function is discussed.\nFinally, for an arbitrary frequency range, the proper distance between two test\nmasses is calculated and its usefulness in the high-frequency limit for\nspace-based interferometers is briefly considered.",

However, the amount\nof information and experience that can flow around in the course of one,\nrelatively short, meeting is really quite limited. Ideally, these meetings\nshould be just a part of a much greater, continuous exchange of knowledge. In\npractice, with some notable - but often short-lived - exceptions, we generally\nfall short of that ideal. Keeping track of what is being used, where, and how\nsuccessfully, can be a challenge. A variety of new technologies such as those\nroughly classed as 'Web 2.0' are now available, and getting information to flow\nought to be getting simpler, but somehow it seems harder to find the time to\nkeep that information current. This paper looks at some of the ways we\ncommunicate, used to communicate, have failed to communicate, no longer\ncommunicate, and perhaps could communicate better. It is presented in the hope\nof stimulating additional discussion - and possibly even a little action -\naimed at improving the current situation.",

        "summary": "The photon density on the ground is a fundamental quantity in all experiments\nbased on Cherenkov light measurements, e.g. in the Imaging Air Cherenkov\nTelescopes (IACT). IACT's are commonly and successfully used in order to search\nand study Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources. Difficulties with\nseparating primary photons from primary hadrons (mostly protons) in Cherenkov\nexperiments become larger at lower energies. I have calculated longitudinal and\nlateral density distributions and their fluctuations at low energies basing on\nMonte Carlo simulations (for vertical gamma cascades and protonic showers) to\ncheck the influence of the detector parameters on the possible measurement.\nRelative density fluctuations are significantly higher in proton than in photon\ninduced showers. Taking into account the limited detector field of view (FOV)\nimplies the changes of these calculated distributions for both types of primary\nparticles and causes an enlargement in relative fluctuations. Absorption due to\nRayleigh and Mie scattering has an impact on mean values but does not change\nrelative fluctuations. The total number of Cherenkov photons is more sensitive\nto the observation height in gamma cascades than in proton showers at low\nprimary energies. The relative fluctuations of the density do not depend on the\nreflector size in the investigated size range (from 240 m^2 up to 960 m^2).\nThis implies that a single telescope with a mirror area larger than that of the\nMAGIC telescope cannot achieve better energy resolution than estimated and\npresented in this paper. The correlations between longitudinal and lateral\ndistributions are much more pronounced for primary gamma-ray than for primary\nproton showers.",

Between January 2007 and March 2008, we observed T1OriC with\nVLTI/AMBER near-infrared (H- and K-band) long-baseline interferometry, as well\nas with bispectrum speckle interferometry with the ESO 3.6m and the BTA 6m\ntelescopes (B'- and V'-band). Combining AMBER data taken with three different\n3-telescope array configurations, we reconstructed the first VLTI/AMBER\nclosure-phase aperture synthesis image, showing the T1OriC system with a\nresolution of approx. 2 mas. To extract the astrometric data from our\nspectrally dispersed AMBER data, we employed a new algorithm, which fits the\nwavelength-differential visibility and closure phase modulations along the H-\nand K-band and is insensitive to calibration errors induced, for instance, by\nchanging atmospheric conditions. Our new astrometric measurements show that the\ncompanion has nearly completed one orbital revolution since its discovery in\n1997. The derived orbital elements imply a short-period (P=11.3 yrs) and\nhigh-eccentricity orbit (e=0.6) with periastron passage around 2002.6. The new\norbit is consistent with recently published radial velocity measurements, from\nwhich we can also derive the first direct constraints on the mass ratio of the\nbinary components. We employ various methods to derive the system mass\n(M_system=44+/-7 M_sun) and the dynamical distance (d=410+/-20 pc), which is in\nremarkably good agreement with recently published trigonometric parallax\nmeasurements obtained with radio interferometry.",

        "summary": "Bolometric Interferometry (BI) is one of the most promising techniques for\nprecise measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization. In this\npaper, we present the results of DIBO (Demonstrateur d'Interferometrie\nBolometrique), a single-baseline demonstrator operating at 90 GHz, built to\nproof the validity of the BI concept applied to a millimeter-wave\ninterferometer. This instrument has been characterized in the laboratory with a\ndetector at room temperature and with a 4 K bolometer. This allowed us to\nmeasure interference patterns in a clean way, both (1) rotating the source and\n(2) varying with time the phase shift among the two interferometer's arms.\nDetailed modelisation has also been performed and validated with measurements.",

We systematically examine this\nscalability, which has so far only briefly discussed in astrophysical\nliterature. We show how the scalability is limited by various constraints\nimposed by physical processes and initial conditions. Using supernova remnants\nin different environments and evolutionary phases as application examples, we\ndemonstrate the use of the scaling as a powerful tool to explore the\ninterdependence among relevant parameters, based on a minimum set of\nsimulations. In particular, we devise a scaling scheme that can be used to\nadaptively generate numerous seed remnants and plant them into 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the supernova-dominated interstellar medium.",

The results confirm the decay and merging of globulars as a\nviable scenario for the formation/accretion of compact nuclear clusters.\nSpecifically: i) the frictional orbital decay is about 2 times faster than that\npredicted by the generalized Chandrasekhar formula; ii) the progenitor clusters\nmerge in less than 20 galactic core-crossing time; iii) the NC configuration\nkeeps a quasi-stable state at least within 70 galactic core-crossing times.",

Shielding\nof man-made interference from long-range radio broadcasts, strong natural radio\nemission from the Earth's aurora, and the need for setting up a large\ndistributed antenna array make the lunar far side a supreme location for a\nlow-frequency radio array. A number of new scientific drivers for such an\narray, such as the study of the dark ages and epoch of reionization,\nexoplanets, and ultra-high energy cosmic rays, have emerged and need to be\nstudied in greater detail. Here we review the scientific potential and\nrequirements of these and other new scientific drivers and discuss the\nconstraints for various lunar surface arrays. In particular we describe\nobservability constraints imposed by the interstellar and interplanetary\nmedium, calculate the achievable resolution, sensitivity, and confusion limit\nof a dipole array using general scaling laws, and apply them to various\nscientific questions. Whichever science is deemed most important, pathfinder\narrays are needed to test the feasibility of these experiments in the not too\ndistant future. Lunar low-frequency arrays are thus a timely option to\nconsider, offering the potential for significant new insights into a wide range\nof today's crucial scientific topics.

An even more acute\ninference should stem from the study of maps of the polarization state of the\nCMB radiation. Measuring the extremely weak CMB polarization signal requires\nvery sensitive instruments. The full-sky maps of both temperature and\npolarization anisotropies of the CMB to be delivered by the upcoming Planck\nSurveyor satellite experiment are hence being awaited with excitement.\nMultiscale methods, such as isotropic wavelets, steerable wavelets, or\ncurvelets, have been proposed in the past to analyze the CMB temperature map.\nIn this paper, we contribute to enlarging the set of available transforms for\npolarized data on the sphere. We describe a set of new multiscale\ndecompositions for polarized data on the sphere, including decimated and\nundecimated Q-U or E-B wavelet transforms and Q-U or E-B curvelets. The\nproposed transforms are invertible and so allow for applications in data\nrestoration and denoising.",

        "title": "Do we really know the dust? Systematics and uncertainties of the\n  mid-infrared spectral analysis methods",
        "summary": "The spectral region around 10 micrometer, showing prominent dust emission\nbands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary\ndust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the\ninfluence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral\ndecomposition methods. We find that, for ground-based observations (8-13\nmicrometer) the expected uncertainty in the value of the crystallinity is about\n11% for a signal-to-noise ratio of 100, while for space-based observations\n(7-17 micrometer) the uncertainty is about 5%. On the basis of our results, we\npropose a recipe for the analysis and interpretation of dust spectroscopy data\nin the mid-infrared which should be especially valuable for analysing Spitzer\ndata and ground-based infrared spectroscopy data in the 10 micrometer window.",

        "summary": "We present sensitive aperture synthesis observations of the nearby, late-type\nspiral galaxy NGC 6503, and produce HI maps of considerably higher quality than\nprevious observations by van Moorsel & Wells (1985). We find that the velocity\nfield, while remarkably regular, contains clear evidence for irregularities.\nThe HI is distributed over an area much larger than the optical image of the\ngalaxy, with spiral features in the outer parts and localized holes within the\nHI distribution. The absence of absorption towards the nearby quasar 1748+700\nyields an upper limit of 5 10^{17} cm^{-2} for the column density of cold HI\ngas along a line of sight which should intersect the disk at a radius of 29\nkpc. This suggests that the radial extent of the HI disk is not much larger\nthan that which we trace in HI emission (23 kpc). The observed HI distribution\nis inconsistent with models of a single thin or thick disk. Instead, the data\nrequire a model containing a thin disk plus a thicker low column-density HI\nlayer that rotates more slowly than the thin disk and that extends only to\napproximately the optical radius. This suggests that the presence of\nextra-planar gas in this galaxy is largely the result of star formation in the\ndisk rather than cold gas accretion. Improved techniques for interferometric\nimaging including multi-scale Clean that were used in this work are also\ndescribed.",

        "summary": "A new reduction of the astrometric data as produced by the Hipparcos mission\nhas been published, claiming that the accuracies for nearly all stars brighter\nthan magnitude $\\mathrm{Hp}=8$ are improved, by up to a factor 4, compared to\nthe original catalogue. As correlations between the underlying abscissa\nresiduals have also been reduced by more than an order of magnitude to an\ninsignificant level, our ability to determine reliable parallaxes and proper\nmotions for open clusters should be improved. The new Hipparcos astrometric\ncatalogue is used to derive mean parallax and proper motion estimates for 20\nopen clusters. The HR-diagrams of the nearest clusters are compared and\ncombined to provide future input to sets of observational isochrones. The\npositions of the cluster HR diagrams are consistent within different groups of\nclusters shown for example by the near-perfect alignment of the sequences for\nthe Hyades and Praesepe, for Coma Ber and UMa, and for the Pleiades, NGC 2516,\nand Blanco 1. The groups are mutually consistent when systematic differences in\n$\\Delta c_0$ are taken into account, where the effect of these differences on\nthe absolute magnitudes has been calibrated using field-star observations.",

        "summary": "The Crab nebula and pulsar have been widely used as a calibration source for\nX-ray instruments. The in-flight effective area calibration of the Reflection\nGrating Spectrometers (RGS) of XMM-Newton depend upon the availability of\nreliable calibration sources. We investigate how the absolute effective area\ncalibration of RGS can be obtained using Crab as a standard candle. We have\nanalysed RGS observations of the Crab using different instrument configurations\nand spatial offsets, and made use of previous determinations of the continuum\nspectrum of the nebula plus pulsar. Due to the high spectral resolution of the\nRGS, we resolve the main absorption edges and detect the strong 1s-2p\nabsorption lines of neutral oxygen. We get an excellent fit to the Crab\nspectrum using this fixed continuum and the absorption spectrum determined by\nRGS. We get accurate column densities for the neutral atoms of H, N, O, Ne, Mg,\nand Fe, as well as a clear detection of Fe II and firm upper limits for other\nions. Our data are in good agreement with earlier optical and UV spectroscopic\nmeasurements of some of these ions. We find solar abundances for N and O, while\nNe is overabundant by a factor of 1.7 and Fe is underabundant by a factor of\n0.8. We confirm that there is less dust in the line of sight compared to the\nprediction based on the absorption column. Our spectra suggest a more prominent\nrole of ferric iron in the dust compared to ferrous iron. Our high-resolution\nobservations confirm that Crab can be used as an X-ray calibration source. RGS\nspectra have determined the absorption spectrum towards Crab with unprecedented\ndetail.",

        "title": "Monte-Carlo simulations of the background of the coded-mask camera for\n  X- and Gamma-rays on-board the Chinese-French GRB mission SVOM",
        "summary": "For several decades now, wide-field coded mask cameras have been used with\nsuccess to localise Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In these instruments, the event\ncount rate is dominated by the photon background due to their large field of\nview and large effective area. It is therefore essential to estimate the\ninstrument background expected in orbit during the early phases of the\ninstrument design in order to optimise the scientific performances of the\nmission. We present here a detailed study of the instrument background and\nsensitivity of the coded-mask camera for X- and Gamma-rays (CXG) to be used in\nthe detection and localisation of high-redshift GRBs on-board the international\nGRB mission SVOM. To compute the background spectrum, a Monte-Carlo approach\nwas used to simulate the primary and secondary interactions between particles\nfrom the main components of the space environment that SVOM will encounter\nalong its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) (with an altitude of 600 km and an inclination\nof ~ 30 deg) and the body of the CXG. We consider the detailed mass model of\nthe CXG in its latest design. According to our results, i) the design of the\npassive shield of the camera ensures that in the 4-50 keV imaging band the\ncosmic X-Gamma-ray background is dominant whilst the internal background should\nstart to become dominant above 70-90 keV; ii) the current camera design ensures\nthat the CXG camera will be more sensitive to high-redshift GRBs than the Swift\nBurst Alert Telescope thanks to a low-energy threshold of 4 keV.",

This paper describes the\nLAT, its pre-flight expected performance, and summarizes the key science\nobjectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in\ndetail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a\nprecision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4x4 array of 16\nmodules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array,\nand a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has\na vertical stack of 18 x,y tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of\nsingle-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten)\nper tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an 8\nlayer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths. The\naspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4 allowing a large\nfield-of-view (2.4 sr). Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (i) permit\nrapid notification of high-energy gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and transients and\nfacilitate monitoring of variable sources, (ii) yield an extensive catalog of\nseveral thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (iii)\nmeasure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources,\n(iv) localize point sources to 0.3 - 2 arc minutes, (v) map and obtain spectra\nof extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (vi)\nmeasure the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background up to TeV energies, and\n(vii) explore the discovery space for dark matter.",

Studying radiative shocks, their\ntopology, and thermodynamical properties is therefore a starting point to\nunderstanding their physical properties. This study has become possible with\nthe development of large laser facilities, which has provided fresh impulse to\nlaboratory astrophysics. We present the main characteristics of radiative\nshocks modeled using cylindrical simulations. We focus our discussion on the\nimportance of multi-dimensional radiative-transfer effects on the shock\ntopology and dynamics. We present results obtained with our code HERACLES for\nconditions corresponding to experiments already performed on laser\ninstallations. The multi-dimensional hydrodynamic code HERACLES is specially\nadapted to laboratory astrophysics experiments and to astrophysical situations\nwhere radiation and hydrodynamics are coupled. The importance of the ratio of\nthe photon mean free path to the transverse extension of the shock is\nemphasized. We present how it is possible to achieve the stationary limit of\nthese shocks in the laboratory and analyze the angular distribution of the\nradiative flux that may emerge from the walls of the shock tube. Implications\nof these studies for stellar accretion shocks are presented.",

        "summary": "This paper presents how photonics associated with new arising detection\ntechnologies is able to provide fully integrated instrument for coherent beam\ncombination applied to astrophysical interferometry. The feasibility and\noperation of on-chip coherent beam combiners has been already demonstrated\nusing various interferometric combination schemes. More recently we proposed a\nnew detection principle aimed at directly sampling and extracting the spectral\ninformation of an input signal together with its flux level measurement. The\nso-called SWIFTS demonstrated concept that stands for Stationary-Wave\nIntegrated Fourier Transform Spectrometer, provides full spectral and spatial\ninformation recorded simultaneously thanks to a motionless detecting device.\n  Due to some newly available detection principles considered for the\nimplementation of the SWIFTS concept, some technologies can even provide\nphoto-counting operation that brought a significant extension of the\ninterferometry domain of investigation in astrophysics . The proposed concept\nis applicable to most of the interferometric instrumental modes including\nfringe tracking, fast and sensitive detection, Fourier spectral reconstruction\nand also to manage a large number of incoming beams. The paper presents three\npractical implementations, two dealing with pair-wise integrated optics beam\ncombinations and the third one with an all-in-one 8 beam combination. In all\ncases the principles turned into a pair wise baseline coding after proper data\nprocessing.",

        "title": "Data inversion for over-resolved spectral imaging in astronomy",
        "summary": "We present an original method for reconstructing a three-dimensional object\nhaving two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension from data provided by\nthe infrared slit spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. During\nacquisition, the light flux is deformed by a complex process comprising four\nmain elements (the telescope aperture, the slit, the diffraction grating and\noptical distortion) before it reaches the two-dimensional sensor.\n  The originality of this work lies in the physical modelling, in integral\nform, of this process of data formation in continuous variables. The inversion\nis lso approached with continuous variables in a semi-parametric format\ndecomposing the object into a family of Gaussian functions. The estimate is\nbuilt in a deterministic regularization framework as the minimizer of a\nquadratic criterion.\n  These specificities give our method the power to over-resolve. Its\nperformance is illustrated using real and simulated data. We also present a\nstudy of the resolution showing a 1.5-fold improvement relative to conventional\nmethods.",

        "title": "Study of the atmospheric refraction in a single mode instrument -\n  Application to AMBER/VLTI",
        "summary": "This paper presents a study of the atmospheric refraction and its effect on\nthe light coupling efficiency in an instrument using single-mode optical\nfibers. We show the analytical approach which allowed us to assess the need to\ncorrect the refraction in J- and H-bands while observing with an 8-m Unit\nTelescope. We then developed numerical simulations to go further in\ncalculations. The hypotheses on the instrumental characteristics are those of\nAMBER (Astronomical Multi BEam combineR), the near infrared focal beam combiner\nof the Very Large Telescope Interferometric mode (VLTI), but most of the\nconclusions can be generalized to other single-mode instruments. We used the\nsoftware package caos (Code for Adaptive Optics Systems) to take into account\nthe atmospheric turbulence effect after correction by the ESO system MACAO\n(Multi-Application Curvature Adaptive Optics). The opto-mechanical study and\ndesign of the system correcting the atmospheric refraction on AMBER is then\ndetailed. We showed that the atmospheric refraction becomes predominant over\nthe atmospheric turbulence for some zenith angles z and spectral conditions:\nfor z larger than 30{\\circ} in J-band for example. The study of the optical\nsystem showed that it allows to achieve the required instrumental performance\nin terms of throughput in J- and H-bands. First observations in J-band of a\nbright star, alpha Cir star, at more than 30{\\circ} from zenith clearly showed\nthe gain to control the atmospheric refraction in a single mode instrument, and\nvalidated the operating law.",

These include\n~10% errors in the calibrated gain and significant contribution from distant\nsidelobes. In addition, there are ~60% variations between the GBT and\nLeiden/Argentine/Bonn 21 cm line profile intensities, which probably occur\nbecause of the high main-beam efficiency of the GBT. Stokes V profiles from the\nGBT contain inaccuracies that are related to the distant sidelobes.\n  We illustrate these problems, define physically motivated components for the\nsidelobes, and provide numerical results showing the inaccuracies. We provide a\ncorrection scheme for Stokes I 21 cm line profiles that is fairly successful\nand provide some rule-of-thumb comments concerning the accuracy of Stokes V\nprofiles.",

        "title": "Effective area calibration of the reflection grating spectrometers of\n  XMM-Newton. II. X-ray spectroscopy of DA white dwarfs",
        "summary": "White dwarf spectra have been widely used as a calibration source for X-ray\nand EUV instruments. The in-flight effective area calibration of the reflection\ngrating spectrometers (RGS) of XMM-Newton depend upon the availability of\nreliable calibration sources. We investigate how well these white dwarf spectra\ncan be used as standard candles at the lowest X-ray energies in order to gauge\nthe absolute effective area scale of X-ray instruments. We calculate a grid of\nmodel atmospheres for Sirius B and HZ 43A, and adjust the parameters using\nseveral constraints until the ratio of the spectra of both stars agrees with\nthe ratio as observed by the low energy transmission grating spectrometer\n(LETGS) of Chandra. This ratio is independent of any errors in the effective\narea of the LETGS. We find that we can constrain the absolute X-ray spectrum of\nboth stars with better than 5 % accuracy. The best-fit model for both stars is\nclose to a pure hydrogen atmosphere, and we put tight limits to the amount of\nhelium or the thickness of a hydrogen layer in both stars. Our upper limit to\nthe helium abundance in Sirius B is 4 times below the previous detection based\non EUVE data. We also find that our results are sensitive to the adopted\ncut-off in the Lyman pseudo-continuum opacity in Sirius B. We get best\nagreement with a long wavelength cut-off. White dwarf model atmospheres can be\nused to derive the effective area of X-ray spectrometers in the lowest energy\nband. An accuracy of 3-4 % in the absolute effective area can be achieved.",

This site has proven in the last few years to offer\nexcellent atmospheric seeing conditions for high spatial resolution\nobservations. The coronagraphic performances obtained from laboratory\nexperiments and numerical models have been compared with those measured from\ndaytime on-sky data recorded on bright single and multiple stars: Canopus (HD\n45348), and alpha Centauri (HD 128620J). No correction system was used\n(adaptive optics or tip-tilt mirror) so that atmospheric turbulence alone\ndefines the image quality, and thus the coronagraphic performances. Moreover,\nthe experiment could not run under optimal operational conditions due to\nhardware/software problems. Satisfactory results have been obtained: broad band\ntotal rejection exceeding 15 were attained in the visible. This first day-time\nobservation campaign yields an experimental feedback on how to improve the\ninstrument to get optimal performances during future night-time observation\nruns.",

The\nphotogrammetry results show that the deformations in the inner part of the\nplatform are less than 120 micron rms. This is negligible for optical pointing\ncorrections, radio alignment and radio phase errors for the currently\noperational 7-element compact configuration.

        "summary": "Aims: A pilot project has been carried out to measure circumstellar CO\nemission from three OH/IR stars close to the Galactic centre. The intention was\nto find out whether it would be possible to conduct a large-scale survey for\nmass-loss rates using, for example, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).\nSuch a survey would increase our understanding of the evolution of the Galactic\nbulge.\n  Methods: Two millimetre-wave instruments were used: the Nobeyama Millimeter\nArray at 115 GHz and the Submillimeter Array at 230 GHz. An interferometer is\nnecessary as a `spatial filter' in this region of space because of the\nconfusion with interstellar CO emission.\n  Results: Towards two of the stars, CO emission was detected with positions\nand radial velocities coinciding within the statistical errors with the\ncorresponding data of the associated OH sources. However, for one of the stars\nthe line profile is not what one expects for an unresolved expanding\ncircumstellar envelope. We believe that this CO envelope is partially resolved\nand that this star therefore is a foreground star not belonging to the bulge.\n  Conclusions: The results of the observations have shown that it is possible\nto detect line profiles of circumstellar CO from late-type stars both within\nand in the direction of the Galactic bulge. ALMA will be able to detect CO\nemission in short integrations with sensitivity sufficient to estimate\nmass-loss rates from a large number of such stars.",

The extragalactic background light (EBL) spectrum\ncaptures the redshifted energy released from the first stellar objects,\nprotogalaxies, and galaxies throughout cosmic history. Yet, we have not\ndetermined the brightness of the extragalactic sky from UV/optical to\nfar-infrared wavelengths with sufficient accuracy to establish the radiative\ncontent of the Universe to better than an order of magnitude. Among many\nscience topics, an accurate measurement of the EBL spectrum from optical to\nfar-IR wavelengths, will address: What is the total energy released by stellar\nnucleosynthesis over cosmic history? Was significant energy released by\nnon-stellar processes? Is there a diffuse component to the EBL anywhere from\noptical to sub-millimeter? When did first stars appear and how luminous was the\nreionization epoch? Absolute optical to mid-IR EBL spectrum to an\nastrophysically interesting accuracy can be established by wide field imagingat\na distance of 5 AU or above the ecliptic plane where the zodiacal foreground is\nreduced by more than two orders of magnitude.",

The luminosity density profile of the observed galaxy is\nextracted by deprojecting the measured brightness distribution and scaling it\nby a fiduciary, step-function shaped, $raw$ mass-to-light ratio profile\n($M/L$). The resulting raw, discontinuous, total, 3-D mass density profile is\nthen smoothed according to a proposed smoothing prescription. The parameters of\nthis raw $M/L$ are characterised by implementing the observables in a\nmodel-based study.\n  The complete characterisation of the formalism is provided as a function of\nthe measurements of the brightness distribution and $\\sigma_0$. The formalism,\nthus specified, is demonstrated to yield the mass density profiles of a suite\nof test galaxies and is successfully applied to extract the gravitational mass\ndistribution in NGC 3379 and NGC 4499, out to about 3 effective radii.",

This work describes the optimization of the\nsystem performance for the measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for\nsix massive galaxy clusters at redshifts $0.09 - 0.32$. We achieved a point\nsource sensitivity of $63\\pm 7$ mJy with the seven 0.6m dishes in 1 hour of\non-source integration in 2-patch differencing observations. We measured and\ncompensated for the delays between the antennas of our platform-mounted\ninterferometer. Beam switching was used to cancel instrumental instabilities\nand ground pick up. Total power and phase stability were good on time scales of\nhours, and the system was shown to integrate down on equivalent timescales of\n300 hours per baseline/correlation, or about 10 hours for the entire array.\nWhile the broadband correlator leads to good sensitivity, the small number of\nlags in the correlator resulted in poorly measured bandpass response. We\ncorrected for this by using external calibrators (Jupiter and Saturn). Using\nJupiter as the flux standard, we measured the disk brightness temperature of\nSaturn to be $149^{+5}_{-12}$ K.",

        "summary": "The very recent years have seen a promising start in scientific publications\nmaking use of images produced by near-infrared long-baseline interferometry.\nThe technique has reached, at last, a technical maturity level that opens new\navenues for numerous astrophysical topics requiring milli-arcsecond\nmodel-independent imaging. The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) is on\nthe path to be equipped with instruments capable to combine between four to six\ntelescopes. In the framework of the VLTI second generation instruments Gravity\nand VSI, we propose a new beam combining concept using Integrated Optics (IO)\ntechnologies with a novel ABCD-like fringe encoding scheme. Our goal is to\ndemonstrate that IO-based combination brings considerable advantages in terms\nof instrumental design and performance. We therefore aim at giving a full\ncharacterization of an IO beam combiner to establish its performances and check\nits compliance with the specifications of an imaging instrument. Laboratory\nmeasurements were made in the H band with a dedicated testbed. We studied the\nbeam combiners through the analysis of throughput, instrumental visibilities,\nphases and closure phases in wide band as well as with spectral dispersion.\nStudy of the polarization properties is also done. We obtain competitive\nthroughput, high and stable instrumental contrasts, stable but non-zero closure\nphases which we attribute to internal well calibrable optical path differences.\nWe validate a new static and achromatic phase shifting IO function close to the\nnominal 90deg value. All these observables show limited chromaticity over the H\nband range. Our results demonstrate that such ABCD-like beam combiners are\nparticularly well suited to achieve aperture synthesis imaging. This opens the\nway to extend to all near infrared wavelengths and in particular, the K band.",

We\nuse a higher order Godunov Riemann solver for the computation of interface\nfluxes. We use two constrained transport methods to compute the electric field\nfrom those interface fluxes, which simultaneously advances the induction\nequation and maintains the divergence of the magnetic field. A third order\ndivergence free reconstruction technique is used to interpolate the magnetic\nfields in the block structured AMR framework already extant in Enzo. This\nreconstruction also preserves the divergence of the magnetic field to machine\nprecision. We use operator splitting to include gravity and cosmological\nexpansion. We then present a series of cosmological and non cosmological tests\nproblems to demonstrate the quality of solution resulting from this combination\nof solvers.",

We\ndemonstrate that the influence of the companion can be measured with precision\nby measuring the phase closure of the system near the nulls of the primary\nvisibility function. In these regions of phase closure nulling, frequency\nintervals always exist where the phase closure signature of the companion is\nlarger than any systematic error and can then be measured.We show that this\ntechnique allows retrieval of many astrophysically relevant properties of faint\nand close companions such as flux, position, and in favorable cases, spectrum.\nWe conclude by a rapid study of the potentialities of phase closure nulling\nobservations with current interferometers and explore the requirements for a\nnew type of dedicated instrument.",

        "summary": "Laboratory measurements of unpolarized and polarized absorption spectra of\nvarious samples and crystal stuctures of silicon carbide (SiC) are presented\nfrom 1200--35,000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\lambda \\sim$ 8--0.28 $\\mu$m) and used to improve\nthe accuracy of optical functions ($n$ and $k$) from the infrared (IR) to the\nultraviolet (UV). Comparison with previous $\\lambda \\sim$ 6--20 $\\mu$m\nthin-film spectra constrains the thickness of the films and verifies that\nrecent IR reflectivity data provide correct values for $k$ in the IR region. We\nextract $n$ and $k$ needed for radiative transfer models using a new\n``difference method'', which utilizes transmission spectra measured from two\nSiC single-crystals with different thicknesses. This method is ideal for\nnear-IR to visible regions where absorbance and reflectance are low and can be\napplied to any material. Comparing our results with previous UV measurements of\nSiC, we distinguish between chemical and structural effects at high frequency.\nWe find that for all spectral regions, 3C ($\\beta$-SiC) and the $\\vec{E}\\bot\n\\vec{c}$ polarization of 6H (a type of $\\alpha$-SiC) have almost identical\noptical functions that can be substituted for each other in modeling\nastronomical environments. Optical functions for $\\vec{E} \\| \\vec{c}$ of 6H SiC\nhave peaks shifted to lower frequency, permitting identification of this\nstructure below $\\lambda \\sim4\\mu$m. The onset of strong UV absorption for pure\nSiC occurs near 0.2 $\\mu$m, but the presence of impurities redshifts the rise\nto 0.33 $\\mu$m. Optical functions are similarly impacted. Such large\ndifferences in spectral characteristics due to structural and chemical effects\nshould be observable and provide a means to distinguish chemical variation of\nSiC dust in space.",

        "title": "Radiative transfer in very optically thick circumstellar disks",
        "summary": "In this paper we present two efficient implementations of the diffusion\napproximation to be employed in Monte Carlo computations of radiative transfer\nin dusty media of massive circumstellar disks. The aim is to improve the\naccuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computation\ntime. The accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in various\ncorners of parameter space are investigated. The effects of using these methods\non the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained from\nhydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. Two methods are\npresented. First, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve the\naccuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,\nwhere photon counts are low. Second, a modified random walk approximation is\nemployed to decrease the computation time. This modified random walk ensures\nthat the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape to\nthe lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in the\ndisk is still computed accurately. A new radiative transfer code, MCMax, is\npresented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. These\ncan be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decrease\nstatistical noise. We conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fast\nand accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structure\nand observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.",

We have applied several imaging\nspeckle reconstruction techniques, and compared them. We have studied\nchromospheric dynamics inside the solar disc and at the limb using H\\alpha with\nvery high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. Keywords (see full\nabstract for details): fibrils, surge, MHD waves, speckle, blind deconvolution,\nFabry-Perot, mini-flares, cloud model, spicules in Halpha, spicules continuing\non the disc) Using He I 10830 we studied the offlimb spicular spectral I\nprofiles with height over the limb. The analysis shows the variation of the\noff-limb emission profiles as a function of the distance to the visible solar\nlimb. The intensity ratio of the multiplet (which is related to the optical\nthickness and coronal irradiation) is studied and compared with standard\natmospheric models. We report observational properties from high-resolution\nfiltergrams in the H$\\alpha$ spectral line taken with the G-FPI. We find that\nspicules can reach heights of 8 Mm above the limb. We show that spicules\noutside the limb continue as dark fibrils inside the disc.",

        "title": "HST/NICMOS detection of HR 8799 b in 1998",
        "summary": "Three planets have been directly imaged around the young star HR 8799. The\nplanets are 5-13 Mjup and orbit the star at projected separations of 24-68 AU.\nWhile the initial detection occurred in 2007, two of the planets were recovered\nin a re-analysis of data obtained in 2004. Here we present a detection of the\nfurthest planet of that system, HR 8799 b, in archival HST/NICMOS data from\n1998. The detection was made using the locally-optimized combination of images\nalgorithm to construct, from a large set of HST/NICMOS images of different\nstars taken from the archive, an optimized reference point-spread function\nimage used to subtract the light of the primary star from the images of HR\n8799. This new approach improves the sensitivity to planets at small\nseparations by a factor of ~10 compared to traditional roll deconvolution. The\nnew detection provides an astrometry point 10 years before the most recent\nobservations, and is consistent with a Keplerian circular orbit with a~70 AU\nand low orbital inclination. The new photometry point, in the F160W filter, is\nin good agreement with an atmosphere model with intermediate clouds and\nvertical stratification, and thus suggests the presence of significant water\nabsorption in the planet's atmosphere. The success of the new approach used\nhere highlights a path for the search and characterization of exoplanets with\nfuture space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or a\nTerrestrial Planet Finder.",

        "title": "A new approach to mitigation of radio frequency interference in\n  interferometric data",
        "summary": "Radio frequency interference (RFI) is the principal factor limiting the\nsensitivities of radio telescopes, particularly at frequencies below 1 GHz. I\npresent a conceptually new approach to mitigation of RFI in interferometric\ndata. This has been used to develop a software tool (RfiX) to remove RFI from\nobservations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India. However, the\nconcept can be used to excise RFI in any interferometer. Briefly, the\nfringe-stopped correlator output of an interferometer baseline oscillates with\nthe fringe-stop period in the presence of RFI. RfiX works by identifying such a\npattern and subtracting it from the data. It is perhaps the only purely\nsoftware technique which can salvage the true visibility value from\nRFI-corrupted data. It neither requires high-speed hardware nor real-time\nprocessing and works best on normal correlator output integrated for 1-10s. It\ncomplements other mitigation schemes with its different approach and the regime\nit addresses. Its ability to work with data integrated over many seconds gives\nit an advantage while excising weak, persistent RFI unlike most other\ntechniques which use high-speed sampling to localise RFI in time-frequency\nplane. RfiX is also different in that it does not require RFI-free data to\nidentify corrupted sections. Some results from the application of RfiX is\npresented including an image at 240 MHz with a Peak/noise ratio of 43000, the\nhighest till date at wavelengths >1m.",

        "summary": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been an enigma since their discovery forty years\nago. However, considerable progress unraveling their mysteries has been made in\nrecent years. Developments in observations, theory, and instrumentation have\nprepared the way so that the next decade can be the one in which we finally\nanswer the question, \"What are gamma-ray bursts?\" This question encompasses not\nonly what the progenitors are that produce the GRBs, but also how the enormous\nluminosity of the GRBs, concentrated in gamma rays, is achieved. Observations\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum, from both the ground and space, will be\nrequired to fully tackle this important question. This white paper, mostly\ndistilled from a recent study commissioned by the Division of Astrophysics of\nthe American Physical Society, focuses on what very high energy (~100 GeV and\nabove) gamma-ray observations can contribute. Very high energy gamma rays probe\nthe most extreme high energy particle populations in the burst environment,\ntesting models of lepton and proton acceleration in GRBs and constraining the\nbulk Lorentz factor and opacity of the outflow. Sensitivity improvements of\nmore than an order of magnitude in the very high energy gamma-ray band can be\nachieved early in the next decade, in order to contribute to this science.",

To utilize their full potential for precision\ncosmology in the following decades, we must precisely understand their physics\n-- from their cool cores stirred by jets produced by the central supermassive\nblack hole (itself fed by inflow of intracluster gas), to their outskirts,\nwhere the infall of intergalactic medium (IGM) drives shocks and accelerates\ncosmic rays. Beyond the cluster confines lies the virtually unexplored warm\nIGM, believed to contain most of the baryonic matter in the present-day\nUniverse. As a depository of all the matter ever ejected from galaxies, it\ncarries unique information on the history of energy and metal production in the\nUniverse. Currently planned major observatories, such as Astro-H and IXO, will\nmake deep inroads into these areas, but to see the most interesting parts of\nthe picture will require an almost science-fiction-grade facility with tens of\nm^2 of effective area, subarcsecond angular resolution, a matching imaging\ncalorimeter and a super high-dispersion spectrograph, such as Generation-X.",

Its observations would make significant progress in studying\nterrestrial planets in their habitable zones to giant planets and circumstellar\ndebris disks, also informing the design of a more capable future mission. It is\nquite exciting that such fundamental exoplanet science can be done with\nrelatively modest capabilities.",

It has been\ninstalled at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory and is currently in\ncommissioning phase. We review the design and performance of the detector and\nits associated systems, present status, preliminary calibration results,\nbackground prediction and projected sensitivity. With a 6000 kg-day\nbackground-free exposure, XENON100 will reach a sensitivity to spin-independent\nWIMP-nucleon cross section of 2e-45 cm2 by the end of 2009. We also discuss our\nplan to upgrade the XENON100 experiment to improve the sensitivity by another\norder of magnitude by 2012.",

Our library\nmimics the GRAPE-6 library, and N-body codes currently running on GRAPE-6 can\nswitch to Sapporo by a simple relinking of the library. The precision of our\nlibrary is comparable to that of GRAPE-6, even though internally the GPU\nhardware is limited to single precision arithmetics. This limitation is\neffectively overcome by emulating double precision for calculating the distance\nbetween particles. The performance loss of this operation is small (< 20%)\ncompared to the advantage of being able to run at high precision. We tested the\nlibrary using several GRAPE-6-enabled N-body codes, in particular with Starlab\nand phiGRAPE. We measured peak performance of 800 Gflop/s for running with 10^6\nparticles on a PC with four commercial G92 architecture GPUs (two GeForce\n9800GX2). As a production test, we simulated a 32k Plummer model with equal\nmass stars well beyond core collapse. The simulation took 41 days, during which\nthe mean performance was 113 Gflop/s. The GPU did not show any problems from\nrunning in a production environment for such an extended period of time.",

Although these\nbeginnings have long been a topic of theoretical interest, technology has only\nrecently allowed the beginnings of observational insight into this epoch. Many\nquestions surround the formation of stars in metal-free gas and the history of\nthe build-up of metals in the intergalactic medium: (1) What were the\nproperties of the first stellar and galactic sources to form in pristine\n(metal-free) gas? (2) When did the epoch of Population III (metal-free) star\nformation take place and how long did it last? (3) Was the stellar initial mass\nfunction dramatically different for the first stars and galaxies? These\nquestions are all active areas of theoretical research. However, new\nobservational constraints via the direct detection of Population III star\nformation are vital to making progress in answering the broader questions\nsurrounding how galaxies formed and how the cosmological properties of the\nuniverse have affected the objects it contains.",

        "summary": "N-body simulations are widely used to simulate the dynamical evolution of a\nvariety of systems, among them star clusters. Much of our understanding of\ntheir evolution rests on the results of such direct N-body simulations. They\nprovide insight in the structural evolution of star clusters, as well as into\nthe occurrence of stellar exotica. Although the major pure N-body codes\nSTARLAB/KIRA and NBODY4 are widely used for a range of applications, there is\nno thorough comparison study yet. Here we thoroughly compare basic quantities\nas derived from simulations performed either with STARLAB/KIRA or NBODY4.\n  We construct a large number of star cluster models for various stellar mass\nfunction settings (but without stellar/binary evolution, primordial binaries,\nexternal tidal fields etc), evolve them in parallel with STARLAB/KIRA and\nNBODY4, analyse them in a consistent way and compare the averaged results\nquantitatively. For this quantitative comparison we develop a bootstrap\nalgorithm for functional dependencies.\n  We find an overall excellent agreement between the codes, both for the\nclusters' structural and energy parameters as well as for the properties of the\ndynamically created binaries. However, we identify small differences, like in\nthe energy conservation before core collapse and the energies of escaping\nstars, which deserve further studies. Our results reassure the comparability\nand the possibility to combine results from these two major N-body codes, at\nleast for the purely dynamical models (i.e. without stellar/binary evolution)\nwe performed.

Fundamental processes from star formation to\nstellar winds to galaxy formation all scale with the number of metals. However,\nsignificant uncertainties remain in both absolute and relative abundances, as\nwell as how these vary with environment, e.g., stellar photospheres versus the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). While UV, optical, IR, and radio studies have\nconsiderably advanced our understanding of ISM gas and dust, they cannot\nprovide uniform results over the entire range of column densities needed. In\ncontrast, X-rays will penetrate gas and dust in the cold (3K) to hot\n(100,000,000K) Universe over a wide range of column densities (log NH=20-24\ncm^-2), imprinting spectral signatures that reflect the individual atoms which\nmake up the gas, molecule or solid. *X-rays therefore are a powerful and viable\nresource for delving into a relatively unexplored regime for determining gas\nabundances and dust properties such as composition, charge state, structure,\nand quantity via absorption studies, and distribution via scattering halos.*",

By\napplying SimClust, we have demonstrated a significant influence of stochastic\neffects on the determined photometric and structural parameters of low-mass\nstar clusters in the M31 galaxy disk.

Section 2 describes some of the new\nopportunities and compelling themes which will be enabled by advances in\nlaboratory astrophysics. Section 3 provides the scientific context for these\nopportunities. Section 4 discusses some experimental and theoretical advances\nin laboratory astrophysics required to realize the PSF scientific opportunities\nof the next decade. As requested in the Call for White Papers, we present in\nSection 5 four central questions and one area with unusual discovery potential.\nWe give a short postlude in Section 6.",

By default, XIM simulates Chandra and the International X-ray\nObservatory (IXO), but can accommodate any user-specified telescope parameters\nand instrument responses. Examples of XIM applications include virtual Chandra\nimaging of simulated X-ray cavities from AGN feedback in galaxy clusters,\nkinematic mapping of cluster velocity fields (e.g., due to mergers or AGN\nfeedback), as well as detailed spectral modeling of multi-phase,\nmulti-temperature spectra from space plasmas.",

        "summary": "The space-time correlations of streams of photons can provide fundamentally\nnew channels of information about the Universe. Today's astronomical\nobservations essentially measure certain amplitude coherence functions produced\nby a source. The spatial correlations of wave fields has traditionally been\nexploited in Michelson-style amplitude interferometry. However the technology\nof the past was largely incapable of fine timing resolution and recording\nmultiple beams. When time and space correlations are combined it is possible to\nachieve spectacular measurements that are impossible by any other means.\nStellar intensity interferometry is ripe for development and is one of the few\nunexploited mechanisms to obtain potentially revolutionary new information in\nastronomy. As we discuss below, the modern use of stellar intensity\ninterferometry can yield unprecedented measures of stellar diameters, binary\nstars, distance measures including Cepheids, rapidly rotating stars, pulsating\nstars, and short-time scale fluctuations that have never been measured before.",

        "summary": "In 2004, McLaughlin et al. discovered a phenomenon in the radio emission of\nPSR J0737-3039B (B) that resembles drifting sub-pulses. The repeat rate of the\nsub-pulses is equal to the spin frequency of PSR J0737-3039A (A); this led to\nthe suggestion that they are caused by incidence upon B's magnetosphere of\nelectromagnetic radiation from A. Here we describe a geometrical model which\npredicts the delay of B's sub-pulses relative to A's radio pulses. We show that\nmeasuring these delays is equivalent to tracking A's rotation from the point of\nview of an hypothetical observer located near B. This has three main\nastrophysical applications: (a) to determine the sense of rotation of A\nrelative to its orbital plane; (b) to estimate where in B's magnetosphere the\nradio sub-pulses are modulated and (c) to provide an independent estimate of\nthe mass ratio of A and B. The latter might improve existing tests of\ngravitational theories using this system.",

But the fields drifted apart\nin the 20th century as astronomy turned towards astrophysics and statistics\ntowards human affairs. Today we see a resurgence in astrostatistical activity\nwith the proliferation of survey mega-datasets and the need to link complicated\ndata to nonlinear astrophysical models. Several contemporary astrostatistical\nchallenges are outlined: heteroscedastic measurement errors, censoring and\ntruncation in multivariate databases; time series analysis of variable objects\nincluding dynamical models of extrasolar planetary systems; treatments of faint\nsources and other Poisson processes; the anisotropic spatial point process of\ngalaxy clustering; and model fitting and selection for the cosmic microwave\nbackground.",

        "summary": "Our aim is to present a fast and general Bayesian inference framework based\non the synergy between machine learning techniques and standard sampling\nmethods and apply it to infer the physical properties of clumpy dusty torus\nusing infrared photometric high spatial resolution observations of active\ngalactic nuclei. We make use of the Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm for sampling the posterior distribution function. Such\ndistribution results from combining all a-priori knowledge about the parameters\nof the model and the information introduced by the observations. The main\ndifficulty resides in the fact that the model used to explain the observations\nis computationally demanding and the sampling is very time consuming. For this\nreason, we apply a set of artificial neural networks that are used to\napproximate and interpolate a database of models. As a consequence, models not\npresent in the original database can be computed ensuring continuity. We focus\non the application of this solution scheme to the recently developed public\ndatabase of clumpy dusty torus models. The machine learning scheme used in this\npaper allows us to generate any model from the database using only a factor\n10^-4 of the original size of the database and a factor 10^-3 in computing\ntime. The posterior distribution obtained for each model parameter allows us to\ninvestigate how the observations constrain the parameters and which ones remain\npartially or completely undetermined, providing statistically relevant\nconfidence intervals. As an example, the application to the nuclear region of\nCentaurus A shows that the optical depth of the clouds, the total number of\nclouds and the radial extent of the cloud distribution zone are well\nconstrained using only 6 filters.",

        "title": "Application of the Trend Filtering Algorithm on the MACHO Database",
        "summary": "Due to the strong effect of systematics/trends in variable star observations,\nwe employ the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) on a subset of the MACHO database\nand search for variable stars. TFA has been applied successfully in planetary\ntransit searches, where weak, short-lasting periodic dimmings are sought in the\npresence of noise and various systematics (due to, e.g., imperfect flat\nfielding, crowding, etc). These latter effects introduce colored noise in the\nphotometric time series that can lead to a complete miss of the signal. By\nusing a large number of available photometric time series of a given field, TFA\nutilizes the fact that the same types of systematics appear in several/many\ntime series of the same field. As a result, we fit each target time series by a\n(least-square-sense) optimum linear combination of templates and\nfrequency-analyze the residuals. Once a signal is found, we reconstruct the\nsignal by employing the full model, including the signal, systematics and\nnoise. We apply TFA on the brightest ~5300 objects from subsets of each of the\nMACHO Large Magellanic Cloud fields #1 and #79. We find that the Fourier\nfrequency analysis performed on the original data detect some 60% of the\nobjects as trend-dominated. This figure decreases essentially to zero after\nusing TFA. Altogether, We detect 387 variables in the two fields, 183 of which\nwould have remained undetected without using TFA. Where possible, we give\npreliminary classification of the variables found.",

The key features of the approach are a simple, thin-layer,\nthree-parameter model of the atmosphere; using the absolute measurements from\nthe radiometers to constrain the model; priors to incorporate physical\nconstraints and ancillary information; and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\ncharacterisation of the posterior distribution including full distributions for\nthe phase correction coefficients. The outcomes of the procedure are therefore\nestimates of the coefficients and their confidence intervals. We illustrate the\ntechnique with simulations showing some degeneracies that can arise and the\nimportance of priors in tackling them. We then apply the technique to an\nhour-long test observation at the Sub-Millimetre Array and find that the\ntechnique is stable and that, in this case, its performance is close to\noptimal. The modelling is described in detail in the appendices and all of the\nimplementation source code is made publicly available under the GPL.",

In order to test the reliability of\nsuch tools, we present a benchmark of radiative transfer codes in a 2D disc\nconfiguration. We test the accuracy of seven independently developed radiative\ntransfer codes by comparing the temperature structures, spectral energy\ndistributions, scattered light images, and linear polarisation maps that each\nmodel predicts for a variety of disc opacities and viewing angles. The test\ncases have been chosen to be numerically challenging, with midplane optical\ndepths up 10^6, a sharp density transition at the inner edge and complex\nscattering matrices. We also review recent progress in the implementation of\nthe Monte Carlo method that allow an efficient solution to these kinds of\nproblems and discuss the advantages and limitations of Monte Carlo codes\ncompared to those of discrete ordinate codes. For each of the test cases, the\npredicted results from the radiative transfer codes are within good agreement.\nThe results indicate that these codes can be confidently used to interpret\npresent and future observations of protoplanetary discs.",

        "title": "Variable polarization measured in the prompt emission of GRB 041219A\n  using IBIS on board INTEGRAL",
        "summary": "Polarization measurements provide direct insight into the nature of\nastrophysical processes. Unfortunately, only a few instruments are available\nfor this kind of measurements at gamma-ray energies, and the sources need to be\nvery bright. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are ideal candidates due to their large\nflux over limited time intervals, maximizing the available signal-to-noise\nratio. To date a few polarization measurements have been reported, claiming of\na high degree of polarization in the prompt emission of GRBs but with low\nstatistical evidence.\n  We used the IBIS telescope on board the INTEGRAL satellite to measure the\npolarization of the prompt gamma-ray emission of the long and bright GRB\n041219A in the 200-800 keV energy band. We find a variable degree of\npolarization ranging from less than 4% over the first peak to 43+/-25% for the\nwhole second peak. Time resolved analysis of both peaks indicates a high degree\nof polarization, and the null average polarization in the first peak can be\nexplained by the rapid variations observed in the polarization angle and\ndegree.\n  Our results are consistent with different models for the prompt emission of\nGRBs at these energies, but they favor synchrotron radiation from a\nrelativistic outflow with a magnetic field which is coherent on an angular size\ncomparable with the angular size of the emitting region (~1/Gamma) . Indeed\nthis model has the best capabilities to maintain a high polarization level, and\nto produce the observed variability.",

        "summary": "The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a dipole-based aperture array\nsynthesis telescope designed to operate in the 80-300 MHz frequency range. It\nis capable of a wide range of science investigations, but is initially focused\non three key science projects. These are detection and characterization of\n3-dimensional brightness temperature fluctuations in the 21cm line of neutral\nhydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) at redshifts from 6 to 10,\nsolar imaging and remote sensing of the inner heliosphere via propagation\neffects on signals from distant background sources,and high-sensitivity\nexploration of the variable radio sky. The array design features 8192\ndual-polarization broad-band active dipoles, arranged into 512 tiles comprising\n16 dipoles each. The tiles are quasi-randomly distributed over an aperture\n1.5km in diameter, with a small number of outliers extending to 3km. All\ntile-tile baselines are correlated in custom FPGA-based hardware, yielding a\nNyquist-sampled instantaneous monochromatic uv coverage and unprecedented point\nspread function (PSF) quality. The correlated data are calibrated in real time\nusing novel position-dependent self-calibration algorithms. The array is\nlocated in the Murchison region of outback Western Australia. This region is\ncharacterized by extremely low population density and a superbly radio-quiet\nenvironment,allowing full exploitation of the instrumental capabilities.",

        "summary": "In this short paper, we study the photometric precision of stellar light\ncurves obtained by the CoRoT satellite in its planet finding channel, with a\nparticular emphasis on the timescales characteristic of planetary transits.\nTogether with other articles in the same issue of this journal, it forms an\nattempt to provide the building blocks for a statistical interpretation of the\nCoRoT planet and eclipsing binary catch to date.\n  After pre-processing the light curves so as to minimise long-term variations\nand outliers, we measure the scatter of the light curves in the first three\nCoRoT runs lasting more than 1 month, using an iterative non-linear filter to\nisolate signal on the timescales of interest. The bevhaiour of the noise on 2h\ntimescales is well-described a power-law with index 0.25 in R-magnitude,\nranging from 0.1mmag at R=11.5 to 1mmag at R=16, which is close to the\npre-launch specification, though still a factor 2-3 above the photon noise due\nto residual jitter noise and hot pixel events. There is evidence for a slight\ndegradation of the performance over time. We find clear evidence for enhanced\nvariability on hours timescales (at the level of 0.5 mmag) in stars identified\nas likely giants from their R-magnitude and B-V colour, which represent\napproximately 60 and 20% of the observed population in the direction of Aquila\nand Monoceros respectively. On the other hand, median correlated noise levels\nover 2h for dwarf stars are extremely low, reaching 0.05mmag at the bright end.",

The project allots long duration\nballoon flights at one of Earth's poles at an altitude of 40 km. GEANT4\nsimulations were carried out which determine the atmospheric background and\nattenuation especially for antiparticles.\n  The second part covers the AMS-02 experiment which will be installed in 2010\non the International Space Station at an altitude of about 400 km for about\nthree years to measure cosmic rays without the influence of Earth's atmosphere.\nThe present work focuses on the anticoincidence counter system (ACC). The ACC\nis needed to reduce the trigger rate during periods of high fluxes and to\nreject external particles crossing the tracker from the side or particles\nresulting from interactions within the detector which would otherwise disturb\nthe clean charge and momentum measurements. The last point is especially\nimportant for the measurement of antinuclei and antiparticles.",

Using the simulated data based on the two\nLIGO detectors, we were able to detect 77 signals out of 126 above SNR 5 in\ncoincidence, with 43 missed events characterized by signal to noise ratio SNR\nless than 10. Characterization of the detected signals revealed the merger part\nof the waveform in high time and frequency resolution, free from time-frequency\nuncertainty. We estimated the timelag of the signals between the detectors\nbased on the optimal overlap of the individual KD time-frequency maps, yielding\nestimates accurate within a fraction of a millisecond for half of the events.

        "title": "Data boundary fitting using a generalised least-squares method",
        "summary": "In many astronomical problems one often needs to determine the upper and/or\nlower boundary of a given data set. An automatic and objective approach\nconsists in fitting the data using a generalised least-squares method, where\nthe function to be minimized is defined to handle asymmetrically the data at\nboth sides of the boundary. In order to minimise the cost function, a numerical\napproach, based on the popular downhill simplex method, is employed. The\nprocedure is valid for any numerically computable function. Simple polynomials\nprovide good boundaries in common situations. For data exhibiting a complex\nbehaviour, the use of adaptive splines gives excellent results. Since the\ndescribed method is sensitive to extreme data points, the simultaneous\nintroduction of error weighting and the flexibility of allowing some points to\nfall outside of the fitted frontier, supplies the parameters that help to tune\nthe boundary fitting depending on the nature of the considered problem. Two\nsimple examples are presented, namely the estimation of spectra\npseudo-continuum and the segregation of scattered data into ranges. The\nnormalisation of the data ranges prior to the fitting computation typically\nreduces both the numerical errors and the number of iterations required during\nthe iterative minimisation procedure.",

In the ideal case\nwhere the image pixel values have a random Gaussian distribution, the\nequivalent number of uncompressible noise bits per pixel is given by Nbits\n=log2(sigma * sqrt(12)) and the lossless compression ratio is given by R =\nBITPIX / Nbits + K where BITPIX is the bit length of the pixel values and K is\na measure of the efficiency of the compression algorithm.\n  We perform image compression tests on a large sample of integer astronomical\nCCD images using the GZIP compression program and using a newer FITS\ntiled-image compression method that currently supports 4 compression\nalgorithms: Rice, Hcompress, PLIO, and GZIP. Overall, the Rice compression\nalgorithm strikes the best balance of compression and computational efficiency;\nit is 2--3 times faster and produces about 1.4 times greater compression than\nGZIP. The Rice algorithm produces 75%--90% (depending on the amount of noise in\nthe image) as much compression as an ideal algorithm with K = 0.\n  The image compression and uncompression utility programs used in this study\n(called fpack and funpack) are publicly available from the HEASARC web site.

Using updated cosmic-ray neutron flux measurements, we use\nTALYS 1.0 to investigate the cosmogenic activation of stable isotopes of\nseveral detector targets and find that the cosmogenic isotopes produced inside\nthe target materials and cryostat can result in large backgrounds for dark\nmatter searches and neutrinoless double-beta decay. We use previously published\nlow-background HPGe data to constrain the production of $^{3}H$ on the surface\nand the upper limit is consistent with our calculation. We note that cosmogenic\nproduction of several isotopes in various targets can generate potential\nbackgrounds for dark matter detection and neutrinoless double-beta decay with a\nmassive detector, thus great care should be taken to limit and/or deal with the\ncosmogenic activation of the targets.",

        "summary": "A moderate investment of observing time with the International X-ray\nObservatory to study high-redshift galaxy clusters detected in future\nlarge-scale surveys, will provide cosmological measurements of fundamental\nimportance. IXO observations, combined with lensing follow-up, will measure the\nperturbation growth factor from z=0-2 with an accuracy comparable to, or\npossibly better than, that expected from observations of cosmic shear with\nJDEM, and redshift-space distortions with EUCLID. The growth of structure data\nderived from clusters will significantly improve our knowledge of the dark\nenergy equation of state and will aid in constraining non-GR models for cosmic\nacceleration. IXO observations of the largest, dynamically relaxed clusters\nwill provide a powerful, independent measurement of the cosmological expansion\nhistory using the apparent f_gas(z) trend. Systematic and statistical errors\nfrom this technique are competitive with SNIa and BAO studies, making the test\nextremely useful for improving the accuracy and reliability of the geometric\ncosmological measurements planned for LSST and JDEM. Only by employing a range\nof powerful, independent approaches, including those discussed here, can robust\nanswers to puzzles as profound as the origin of cosmic acceleration be\nexpected.",

The code is an extension of the general purpose\nstellar atmosphere code PHOENIX and is therefore capable of including extensive\nlists of atomic and molecular lines as well as dust in the calculations. We\nassume that the average viscosity can be represented by a critical Reynolds\nnumber in a geometrically thin disk and solve the structure and radiative\ntransfer equations for a number of disk rings in the vertical direction. The\ncombination of these rings provides the total disk structure and spectrum.\nSince the warm inner regions of protoplanetary disks show a rich molecular\nspectrum, they are well suited for a spectral analysis with our models. In this\npaper we test our code by comparing our models with high-resolution VLT CRIRES\nspectra of the T Tauri star GQ Lup.",

This makes LOFAR a\nunique tool for the study of the radio properties of single air showers.\n  Triggering on the radio emission from air showers means detecting a short\nradio pulse and discriminating real events from radio interference. At LOFAR we\nplan to search for pulses in the digital data stream - either from single\nantennas or from already beam-formed data - and calculate several parameters\ncharacterizing the pulse shape to pick out real events in a second stage.

        "summary": "The spectral energy distributions for pure-hydrogen (DA) hot white dwarfs can\nbe accurately predicted by model atmospheres. This makes it possible to define\nspectrophotometric calibrators by scaling the theoretical spectral shapes with\nbroad-band photometric observations -- a strategy successfully exploited for\nthe spectrographs onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using three primary\nDA standards. Absolute fluxes for non-DA secondary standards, introduced to\nincrease the density of calibrators in the sky, need to be referred to the\nprimary standards, but a far better solution would be to employ a network of DA\nstars scattered throughout the sky. We search for blue objects in the sixth\ndata release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and fit DA model fluxes to\nidentify suitable candidates. Reddening needs to be considered in the analysis\nof the hottest and therefore more distant stars. We propose a list of nine\npure-hydrogen white dwarfs with absolute fluxes with estimated uncertainties\nbelow 3%, including four objects with estimated errors <2%, as candidates for\nspectrophotometric standards in the range 14<g<18, and provide model-based\nfluxes scaled to match the SDSS broad-band fluxes for each. We apply the same\nmethod to the three HST DA standards, linking the zero point of their absolute\nfluxes to ugr magnitudes transformed from photometry obtained with the USNO 1-m\ntelescope. For these stars we estimate uncertainties of <1% in the optical,\nfinding good consistency with the fluxes adopted for HST calibration.",

The impact of laboratory astrophysics ranges from the\nscientific conception stage for ground-based, airborne, and space-based\nobservatories, all the way through to the scientific return of these projects\nand missions.

In this regard, laboratory\nastrophysics is much like detector and instrument development at NASA, NSF, and\nDOE. These efforts are necessary for the success of astronomical research being\nfunded by the agencies. Without concomitant efforts in all three directions\n(observational facilities, detector/instrument development, and laboratory\nastrophysics) the future progress of astronomy and astrophysics is imperiled.\nIn addition, new developments in experimental technologies have allowed\nlaboratory studies to take on a new role as some questions which previously\ncould only be studied theoretically can now be addressed directly in the lab.\nWith this in mind we, the members of the AAS Working Group on Laboratory\nAstrophysics, have prepared this State of the Profession Position Paper on the\nlaboratory astrophysics infrastructure needed to ensure the advancement of\nastronomy and astrophysics in the next decade.",

        "title": "Simbol-X Hard X-ray Focusing Mirrors: Results Obtained During the Phase\n  A Study",
        "summary": "Simbol-X will push grazing incidence imaging up to 80 keV, providing a strong\nimprovement both in sensitivity and angular resolution compared to all\ninstruments that have operated so far above 10 keV. The superb hard X-ray\nimaging capability will be guaranteed by a mirror module of 100 electroformed\nNickel shells with a multilayer reflecting coating. Here we will describe the\ntechnogical development and solutions adopted for the fabrication of the mirror\nmodule, that must guarantee an Half Energy Width (HEW) better than 20 arcsec\nfrom 0.5 up to 30 keV and a goal of 40 arcsec at 60 keV. During the phase A,\nterminated at the end of 2008, we have developed three engineering models with\ntwo, two and three shells, respectively. The most critical aspects in the\ndevelopment of the Simbol-X mirrors are i) the production of the 100 mandrels\nwith very good surface quality within the timeline of the mission; ii) the\nreplication of shells that must be very thin (a factor of 2 thinner than those\nof XMM-Newton) and still have very good image quality up to 80 keV; iii) the\ndevelopment of an integration process that allows us to integrate these very\nthin mirrors maintaining their intrinsic good image quality. The Phase A study\nhas shown that we can fabricate the mandrels with the needed quality and that\nwe have developed a valid integration process. The shells that we have produced\nso far have a quite good image quality, e.g. HEW <~30 arcsec at 30 keV, and\neffective area. However, we still need to make some improvements to reach the\nrequirements. We will briefly present these results and discuss the possible\nimprovements that we will investigate during phase B.",

These observations directly probe\nthe location of the dust and gas in the disks. The characteristic sizes of\nthese regions found are larger than previously thought. These results have\nmotivated in part a new class of models of the inner disk structure, but the\nprecise understanding of the origin of these low visibilities is still in\ndebate. Mid-infrared observations probe disk emission over a larger range of\nscales revealing mineralogy gradients in the disk. Recent spectrally resolved\nobservations allow the dust and gas to be studied separately showing that the\nBrackett gamma emission can find its origin either in a wind or in a\nmagnetosphere and that there is probably no correlation between the location of\nthe Brackett gamma emission and accretion. In a certain number of cases, the\nvery high spatial resolution reveals very close companions and can determine\ntheir masses. Overall, these results provide essential information on the\nstructure and the physical properties of close regions surrounding young stars\nespecially where planet formation is suspected to occur.",

        "summary": "Many objects on the sky exhibit a centrosymmetric polarization pattern,\nparticularly in cases involving single scattering around a central source.\nUtilizing a novel liquid crystal device (the ``theta cell'') that transforms\nthe coordinate system of linear polarization in an image plane from Cartesian\nto polar, the observation of centrosymmetric polarization patterns can be\nimproved: instead of measuring Stokes Q and U on the sky, one only needs to\nmeasure Stokes Q' in the new instrument coordinate system. This reduces the\neffective exposure time by a factor of two and simplifies the polarization\nmodulator design. According to the manufacturer's specifications and to\nmeasurements in the lab, the liquid crystal device can be applied in the\nvisible and NIR wavelength range. Astronomical science cases for a``radial\npolarimeter'' include exoplanet detection, imaging of circumstellar disks,\nreflection nebulae and light echos, characterization of planetary atmospheres\nand diagnostics of the solar K-corona. The first astronomical instrument that\nutilizes a theta cell for radial polarimetry is the S5T (Small Synoptic Second\nSolar Spectrum Telescope), which accurately measures scattering polarization\nsignals near the limb of the sun. These observations are crucial for\nunderstanding the nature and origin of weak, turbulent magnetic fields in the\nsolar photosphere and elsewhere in the universe. A ``radial polarimeter''\nobserving a slightly defocused point source performs one-shot full linear\npolarimetry. With a theta cell in a pupil plane, a beam's linear polarization\nproperties (e.g. for calibration purposes) can be fully controlled through\npupil masking.",

This article deals with the accurate measurement and\nmodeling of the polarization properties of real aluminum mirrors, as used in\nastronomical telescopes. Main goals are the characterization of the aluminum\noxide layer thickness at different times after evaporation and its influence on\nthe polarization properties of the mirror. The full polarization properties of\nan aluminum mirror are measured with Mueller matrix ellipsometry at different\nincidence angles and wavelengths. The best fit of theoretical Mueller matrices\nto all measurements simultaneously is obtained by taking into account a model\nof bulk aluminum with a thin aluminum oxide film on top of it. Full Mueller\nmatrix measurements of a mirror are obtained with an absolute accuracy of ~1%\nafter calibration. The determined layer thicknesses indicate logarithmic growth\nin the first few hours after evaporation, but it remains stable at a value of\n4.12+/-0.08 nm on the long term. Although the aluminum oxide layer is\nestablished to be thin, it is necessary to consider it to accurately describe\nthe mirror's polarization properties.",

We provide an easy-to-use full-spectrum fitting package and explore its\napplications to (i) the determination of the stellar atmospheric parameters and\n(ii) the study of the history of stellar populations. Methods. We developed\nULySS, a package to fit spectroscopic observations against a linear combination\nof non-linear model components convolved with a parametric line-of-sight\nvelocity distribution. The minimization can be either local or global, and\ndetermines all the parameters in a single fit. We use chi2 maps, convergence\nmaps and Monte-Carlo simulations to study the degeneracies, local minima and to\nestimate the errors. Results. We show the importance of determining the shape\nof the continuum simultaneously to the other parameters by including a\nmultiplicative polynomial in the model (without prior pseudo-continuum\ndetermination, or rectification of the spectrum). We also stress the benefice\nof using an accurate line-spread function, depending on the wavelength, so that\nthe line-shape of the models properly match the observation. For simple models,\ni. e., to measure the atmospheric parameters or the age/metallicity of a\nsingle-age stellar population, there is often a unique minimum, or when local\nminima exist they can unambiguously be recognized. For more complex models,\nMonte-Carlo simulations are required to assess the validity of the solution.\nConclusions. The ULySS package is public, simple to use and flexible. The full\nspectrum fitting makes optimal usage of the signal.",

This trend is\nlikely to continue over the next decade, as many of the most important\nquestions in astrophysics are best tackled with massive surveys, often in\nsynergy with each other and in tandem with the more traditional observatories.\nWe argue that these surveys are most productive and have the greatest impact\nwhen the data from the surveys are made public in a timely manner. The rise of\nthe \"survey astronomer\" is a substantial change in the demographics of our\nfield; one of the most important challenges of the next decade is to find ways\nto recognize the intellectual contributions of those who work on the\ninfrastructure of surveys (hardware, software, survey planning and operations,\nand databases/data distribution), and to make career paths to allow them to\nthrive.",

        "summary": "Emission line ratios have been essential for determining physical parameters\nsuch as gas temperature and density in astrophysical gaseous nebulae. With the\nadvent of panoramic spectroscopic devices, images of regions with emission\nlines related to these physical parameters can, in principle, also be produced.\nWe show that, with observations from modern instruments, it is possible to\ntransform images taken from density sensitive forbidden lines into images of\nemission from high and low-density clouds by applying a transformation matrix.\nIn order to achieve this, images of the pairs of density sensitive lines as\nwell as the adjacent continuum have to be observed and combined. We have\ncomputed the critical densities for a series of pairs of lines in the infrared,\noptical, ultraviolet and X-rays bands, and calculated the pair line intensity\nratios in the high and low-density limit using a 4 and 5 level atom\napproximation. In order to illustrate the method we applied it to GMOS-IFU data\nof two galactic nuclei. We conclude that this method provides new information\nof astrophysical interest, especially for mapping low and high-density clouds;\nfor this reason we call it \"the ld/hd imaging method\".",

From the\nschool science fair to the search for the secrets of dark energy, high-quality\nresearch consists of scientific investigation constrained within the scope of a\nwell-defined project. Large or small, generously funded or just scraping\nby,scientific projects use time, money, and information to turn ideas into\nplans, plans into action, and action into results. While we, as a community, do\nmuch to educate students in the techniques of research, we do not\nsystematically train students in the nature and organization of scientific\nprojects or in the techniques of project management. We propose a two-pronged\nattack to address this issue in the next decade. First, to generate a broad\nbase of future scientists who have a basic familiarity with the ideas of\nprojects, we propose that the community develop standards for the content of a\nproject design and management course in astronomy and astrophysics. Second, to\ntrain future scientists to assume leadership roles in new investigations in\nastronomy and astrophysics, we propose that the community develop standards for\ngraduate programs in the area of research project leadership.",

        "summary": "Transmission spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets is a potential tool for\nhabitability screening. Transiting planets are present-day \"Rosetta Stones\" for\nunderstanding extrasolar planets because they offer the possibility to\ncharacterize giant planet atmospheres and should provide an access to\nbiomarkers in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets, once they are detected.\nUsing the Earth itself as a proxy we show the potential and limits of the\ntransiting technique to detect biomarkers on an Earth-analog exoplanet in\ntransit. We quantify the Earths cross section as a function of wavelength, and\nshow the effect of each atmospheric species, aerosol, and Rayleigh scattering.\nClouds do not significantly affect this picture because the opacity of the\nlower atmosphere from aerosol and Rayleigh losses dominates over cloud losses.\nWe calculate the optimum signal-to-noise ratio for spectral features in the\nprimary eclipse spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet around a Sun-like star and\nalso M stars, for a 6.5-m telescope in space. We find that the signal to noise\nvalues for all important spectral features are on the order of unity or less\nper transit - except for the closest stars - making it difficult to detect such\nfeatures in one single transit, and implying that co-adding of many transits\nwill be essential.",

        "title": "Low-Energy Astrophysics: Stimulating the Reduction of Energy Consumption\n  in the Next Decade",
        "summary": "In this paper we address the consumption of energy by astronomers while\nperforming their professional duties. Although we find that astronomy uses a\nnegligible fraction of the US energy budget, the rate at which energy is\nconsumed by an average astronomer is similar to that of a typical high-flying\nbusinessperson. We review some of the ways in which astronomers are already\nacting to reduce their energy consumption. In the coming decades, all citizens\nwill have to reduce their energy consumption to conserve fossil fuel reserves\nand to help avert a potentially catastrophic change in the Earth's climate. The\nchallenges are the same for astronomers as they are for everyone: decreasing\nthe distances we travel and investing in energy-efficient infrastructure. The\nhigh profile of astronomy in the media, and the great public interest in our\nfield, can play a role in promoting energy-awareness to the wider population.\nOur specific recommendations are therefore to 1) reduce travel when possible,\nthrough efficient meeting organization, and by investing in high-bandwidth\nvideo conference facilities and virtual-world software, 2) create\nenergy-efficient observatories, computing centers and workplaces, powered by\nsustainable energy resources, and 3) actively publicize these pursuits.",

        "summary": "Proper interpretation and understanding of astronomical data requires good\nknowledge of the data acquisition process. The increase in remote observing,\nqueue observing, and the availability of large archived data products risk\ninsulating astronomers from the telescope, potentially reducing their\nfamiliarity with the observational techniques crucial in understanding the\ndata. Learning fundamental observing techniques can be done in at least three\nways: 1) College and university operated observing facilities, 2) Student\ninvolvement in national facilities through competitive proposals, 3) Programs\nat national facilities to increase upper-level undergraduate and graduate\nstudent exposure to telescopes. We encourage both national organizations and\nuniversities to include programs and funding aimed at supporting hands-on\nexperience with telescopes through the three methods mentioned.",

        "summary": "We present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 <~ z <~ 1\nin the ~1.7 deg^2 COSMOS field, based on the first ~10,000 zCOSMOS spectra. The\nperformance of both the Friends-of-Friends (FOF) and Voronoi-Delaunay-Method\n(VDM) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored and\ncompared using realistic mock catalogues. We find that the performance improves\nsubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-finding\nparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelity\ncatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining the\nindependently created FOF and VDM catalogues. The final completeness and purity\nof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,\ncompares favorably with recent results in the literature. The current group\ncatalogue contains 102 groups with N >= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,\nwith a further ~700 groups with 2 <= N <= 4. Most of the groups can be assigned\na velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,\nwith quantifiable uncertainties. The fraction of zCOSMOS galaxies in groups is\nabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. The zCOSMOS\ngroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analytic\nevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. Not least, we show that the\nnumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases from\nredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth of\nstructure.",

        "summary": "The observations of Mars by the CRISM and OMEGA hyperspectral imaging\nspectrometers require correction for photometric, atmospheric and thermal\neffects prior to the interpretation of possible mineralogical features in the\nspectra. Here, we report on a simple, yet non-trivial, adaptation to the\ncommonly-used volcano-scan correction technique for atmospheric CO_2, which\nallows for the improved detection of minerals with intrinsic absorption bands\nat wavelengths between 1.9-2.1 $\\mu$m. This volcano-scan technique removes the\nabsorption bands of CO_2 by ensuring that the Lambert albedo is the same at two\nwavelengths: 1.890 $\\mu$m and 2.011 $\\mu$m, with the first wavelength outside\nthe CO_2 gas bands and the second wavelength deep inside the CO_2 gas bands.\nOur adaptation to the volcano-scan technique moves the first wavelength from\n1.890 $\\mu$m to be instead within the gas bands at 1.980 $\\mu$m, and for CRISM\ndata, our adaptation shifts the second wavelength slightly, to 2.007 $\\mu$m. We\nalso report on our efforts to account for a slight ~0.001 $\\mu$m shift in\nwavelengths due to thermal effects in the CRISM instrument.",

        "summary": "We discuss the DISORT-based radiative transfer pipeline ('CRISM_LambertAlb')\nfor atmospheric and thermal correction of MRO/CRISM data acquired in\nmultispectral mapping mode (~200 m/pixel, 72 spectral channels). Currently, in\nthis phase-one version of the system, we use aerosol optical depths, surface\ntemperatures, and lower-atmospheric temperatures, all from climatology derived\nfrom Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (MGS-TES) data, and\nsurface altimetry derived from MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). The\nDISORT-based model takes as input the dust and ice aerosol optical depths\n(scaled to the CRISM wavelength range), the surface pressures (computed from\nMOLA altimetry, MGS-TES lower-atmospheric thermometry, and Viking-based\npressure climatology), the surface temperatures, the reconstructed instrumental\nphotometric angles, and the measured I/F spectrum, and then outputs a\nLambertian albedo spectrum. The Lambertian albedo spectrum is valuable\ngeologically since it allows the mineralogical composition to be estimated.\nHere, I/F is defined as the ratio of the radiance measured by CRISM to the\nsolar irradiance at Mars divided by $\\pi$. After discussing the capabilities\nand limitations of the pipeline software system, we demonstrate its application\non several multispectral data cubes: the outer northern ice cap of Mars,\nTyrrhena Terra, and near the landing site for the Phoenix mission. For the icy\nspectra near the northern polar cap, aerosols need to be included in order to\nproperly correct for the CO_2 absorption in the H_{2}O ice bands at wavelengths\nnear 2.0 $\\mu$m. In future phases of software development, we intend to use\nCRISM data directly in order to retrieve the spatiotemporal maps of aerosol\noptical depths, surface pressure and surface temperature.",

        "summary": "Astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members of\nour community. Purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasks\nbecomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations.\nHowever, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards are\nnot always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing software\npublicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead to\nsignificant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. We\nidentify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety of\napproaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality of\nastronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providing\nbenefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by open\naccess to large survey and simulation datasets. Our aim is to open a\nconversation on how to move forward. We advocate that: (1) the astronomical\ncommunity consider software as an integral and fundable part of facility\nconstruction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered as\nintegral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication and\ndata release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing and\ncollaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) that\nwe seek structural incentives to make the release of software and related\npublications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways of\nfunding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink our\nvalues to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just a\ntechnical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice.",

        "title": "Studying the Imaging Characteristics of Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope\n  (UVIT) through Numerical Simulations",
        "summary": "Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the five payloads aboard the\nIndian Space Research Organization (ISRO)'s ASTROSAT space mission. The science\nobjectives of UVIT are broad, extending from individual hot stars, star-forming\nregions to active galactic nuclei. Imaging performance of UVIT would depend on\nseveral factors in addition to the optics, e.g. resolution of the detectors,\nSatellite Drift and Jitter, image frame acquisition rate, sky background,\nsource intensity etc. The use of intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting\ndetectors in UVIT put their own complexity over reconstruction of the images.\nAll these factors could lead to several systematic effects in the reconstructed\nimages. A study has been done through numerical simulations with artificial\npoint sources and archival image of a galaxy from GALEX data archive, to\nexplore the effects of all the above mentioned parameters on the reconstructed\nimages. In particular the issues of angular resolution, photometric accuracy\nand photometric-nonlinearity associated with the intensified CMOS-imager based\nphoton counting detectors have been investigated. The photon events in image\nframes are detected by three different centroid algorithms with some energy\nthresholds. Our results show that in presence of bright sources, reconstructed\nimages from UVIT would suffer from photometric distortion in a complex way and\nthe presence of overlapping photon events could lead to complex patterns near\nthe bright sources. Further the angular resolution, photometric accuracy and\ndistortion would depend on the values of various thresholds chosen to detect\nphoton events.",

        "summary": "We propose the timescale-resolved spectroscopy (TRS) as a new method to\ncombine the timing and spectral study. TRS is based on the time domain power\nspectrum and reflects the variable amplitudes of spectral components on\ndifferent timescales. We produce the TRS with the RXTE PCA data for Cyg X-1 and\nstudied the spectral parameters (the power law photon index and the equivalent\nwidth of the iron fluorescent line) as a function of timescale. The results of\nTRS and frequency-resolved spectra (FRS) have been compared, and similarities\nhave been found for the two methods with the identical motivations. We also\ndiscover the correspondences between the evolution of photon index with\ntimescale and the evolution of the equivalent width with timescale. The\nobservations can be divided into three types according to the correspondences\nand different type is connected with different spectral state.",

        "title": "Laser Guide Stars for Extremely Large Telescopes: Efficient\n  Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor Design using Weighted center-of-gravity\n  algorithm",
        "summary": "Over the last few years increasing consideration has been given to the study\nof Laser Guide Stars (LGS) for the measurement of the disturbance introduced by\nthe atmosphere in optical and near-infrared astronomical observations from the\nground. A possible method for the generation of a LGS is the excitation of the\nSodium layer in the upper atmosphere at approximately 90 km of altitude. Since\nthe Sodium layer is approximately 10 km thick, the artificial reference source\nlooks elongated, especially when observed from the edge of a large aperture.\nThe spot elongation strongly limits the performance of the most common\nwavefront sensors. The centroiding accuracy in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront\nsensor, for instance, decreases proportionally to the elongation (in a photon\nnoise dominated regime). To compensate for this effect a straightforward\nsolution is to increase the laser power, i.e. to increase the number of\ndetected photons per subaperture. The scope of the work presented in this paper\nis twofold: an analysis of the performance of the Weighted Center of Gravity\nalgorithm for centroiding with elongated spots and the determination of the\nrequired number of photons to achieve a certain average wavefront error over\nthe telescope aperture.",

        "summary": "This white paper is submitted to the Astronomy and Astrophysics 2010 Decadal\nSurvey (Astro2010)1 Committee on the State of the Profession to emphasize the\npotential of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to\ncontribute to the training of instrumentalists and observers, and to related\ntechnology developments. This potential goes beyond the primary mission of\nSOFIA, which is to carry out unique, high priority astronomical research.\n  SOFIA is a Boeing 747SP aircraft with a 2.5 meter telescope. It will enable\nastronomical observations anywhere, any time, and at most wavelengths between\n0.3 microns and 1.6 mm not accessible from ground-based observatories. These\nattributes, accruing from the mobility and flight altitude of SOFIA, guarantee\na wealth of scientific return. Its instrument teams (nine in the first\ngeneration) and guest investigators will do suborbital astronomy in a\nshirt-sleeve environment. The project will invest $10M per year in science\ninstrument development over a lifetime of 20 years. This, frequent flight\nopportunities, and operation that enables rapid changes of science instruments\nand hands-on in-flight access to the instruments, assure a unique and extensive\npotential - both for training young instrumentalists and for encouraging and\ndeploying nascent technologies. Novel instruments covering optical, infrared,\nand submillimeter bands can be developed for and tested on SOFIA by their\ndevelopers (including apprentices) for their own observations and for those of\nguest observers, to validate technologies and maximize observational\neffectiveness.",

        "summary": "Solar-axion interaction rates in NaI, CsI and Xe scintillators via the\naxio-electric effect were calculated. A table is presented with photoelectric\nand axioelectric cross sections, solar-axion fluxes, and the interaction rates\nfrom 2.0 to 10.0 keV. The results imply that annual-modulation data of large\nNaI and CsI arrays, and large Xe scintillation chambers, might be made\nsensitive enough to probe coupling to photons at levels required to explain\naxion-photon oscillation phenomena proposed to explain the survival of\nhigh-energy photons traveling cosmological distances. The DAMAA/LIBRA data are\nused to demonstrate the power of the model-independent annual modulation due to\nthe seasonal variation in the earth sun distance.",

        "title": "High-Contrast Observations in Optical and Infrared Astronomy",
        "summary": "High-contrast observations in optical and infrared astronomy are defined as\nany observation requiring a technique to reveal a celestial object of interest\nthat is in such close angular proximity to another source brighter by a factor\nof at least 10^5 that optical effects hinder or prevent the collection of\nphotons directly from the target of observation. This is a relatively new type\nof observation that enables research on previously obscured parts of the\nUniverse. In particular, it is most applicable to Comparative Planetary\nScience, a field that directly attacks such questions as \"how common are\nplanetary systems? What types of planets exist, and are there planets other\nthan Earth that are capable of supporting life as we know it?\" We survey the\nscientific motivations for high-contrast observations, provide an overview of\nthe techniques currently being used or developed, and discuss some ideas and\nstudies for future prospects.",

The various desired technical improvements are being discussed with an\nemphasis on the role of e-VLBI. With this innovation new scientific\ncapabilities are introduced. In this way the EVN is also positioned as an\ninteresting platform for exercising new techniques and operational models,\ncomplementary to other SKA pathfinders. In return, the technology development\nfor the SKA can have a positive impact on the scientific capabilities of VLBI,\nfor example on the development of a next generation correlator, capable to\nprocess much larger data-rates. The development of cheap, frequency agile\nantennas can also be of great importance for VLBI. This adds to the potential\nfor maintaining a Northern hemisphere, global VLBI array in the SKA era.",

        "summary": "We have used our 1.6 m diameter off-axis well-corrected sub-aperture (WCS) on\nthe Palomar Hale telescope in concert with a small inner-working-angle (IWA)\nphase-mask coronagraph to image the immediate environs of a small number of\nnearby stars. Test cases included three stars (HD 130948, HD 49197 and HR7672)\nwith known brown dwarf companions at small separations, all of which were\ndetected. We also present the initial detection of a new object close to the\nnearby young G0V star HD171488. Follow up observations are needed to determine\nif this object is a bona fide companion, but its flux is consistent with the\nflux of a young brown dwarf or low mass M star at the same distance as the\nprimary. Interestingly, at small angles our WCS coronagraph demonstrates a\nlimiting detectable contrast comparable to that of extant Lyot coronagraphs on\nmuch larger telescopes corrected with current-generation AO systems. This\nsuggests that small apertures corrected to extreme adaptive optics (ExAO)\nlevels can be used to carry out initial surveys for close brown dwarf and\nstellar companions, leaving followup observations for larger telescopes.",

The fellowship is one of the few that allows postdoctoral\nresearchers to pursue an original research program, of their own design, at the\nU.S. institution of their choice. However, what makes this fellowship truly\nunique is the ability of Fellows to lead an equally challenging, original\neducational program simultaneously. The legacy of this singular fellowship has\nbeen to encourage and advance leaders in the field who are equally as\npassionate about their own research as they are about sharing that research and\ntheir passion for astronomy with students and the public.\n  In this positional paper we address the importance of fellowships like the\nAAPF to the astronomical profession by identifying the science and educational\ncontributions that Fellows have made to the community. Further, we recommend\nthat fellowships that encourage leading postdoctoral researchers to also become\nleaders in Astronomy education be continued and expanded.",

        "summary": "Promoting racial and ethnic diversity is critically important to the future\nsuccess and growth of the field of astronomy. The raw ability, drive and\ninterest required to excel in the field is distributed without regard to race,\ngender, or socioeconomic background. By not actively promoting diversity in our\nfield we risk losing talented people to other professions (or losing them\nentirely), which means that there will be astronomical discoveries that simply\nwon't get made. There is demonstrated evidence that STEM fields benefit from\ndiverse perspectives on problems that require more complex thought processes.\nThis is especially relevant to a field like astronomy where more and more work\nis being done collaboratively. The lack of notable growth in African American,\nHispanic, and Native American representation in astronomy indicates that the\n'pipeline' for these individuals is systemically leaky at critical junctures.\nSubstantially more effort must be directed toward improving the educational and\ncareer development of minorities to insure that these potential colleagues are\nsupported through the process. However, simply recognizing that the pipeline is\nfaulty is woefully inadequate. There must be very specific, targeted solutions\nto help improve the situation. With this in mind, we offer two position papers\naddressing specific areas of improvement that we identify as (a) essential for\nany foreseeable progress in the field, and (b) attainable in the 2010-2020\ndecade. These position papers focus primarily on African Americans, Hispanics,\nand Native Americans. Although we do not directly address issues of Asian\nAmericans, Pacific Islanders, and other groups, many of the recommendations\nmade here can be adapted to address issues faced by these groups as well.",

        "summary": "If the ethnic makeup of the astronomy profession is to achieve parity with\nthe general population within one generation (~30 years), the number of\nunderrepresented minorities earning graduate degrees in astronomy and\nastrophysics must increase in the coming decade by a factor of 5 to 10. To\naccomplish this, the profession must develop and invest in mechanisms to more\neffectively move individuals across critical educational junctures to the PhD\nand beyond. Early and continuous research engagement starting in the\nundergraduate years is critical to this vision, in which the federally funded\nresearch internship programs (e.g. NSF REU, NASA GSRP) and national\ncenters/observatories play a vital role. Regionally based partnerships with\nminority-serving institutions (MSIs) are crucial for tapping extant pools of\nminority talent, as are post-baccalaurate and/or masters degree \"bridging\"\nprograms that provide critical stepping stones to the PhD. Because of the\nstrong undergraduate physics, engineering, and computer science backgrounds of\nmany students from MSIs, we suggest that instrument development and large scale\ncomputing/data-mining are particularly promising avenues for engagement in the\ncoming decade.",

        "summary": "Laboratory astrophysics and complementary theoretical calculations are the\nfoundations of astronomy and astrophysics and will remain so into the\nforeseeable future. The mission enabling impact of laboratory astrophysics\nranges from the scientific conception stage for airborne and space-based\nobservatories, all the way through to the scientific return of these missions.\nIt is our understanding of the under-lying physical processes and the\nmeasurements of critical physical parameters that allows us to address\nfundamental questions in astronomy and astrophysics. In this regard, laboratory\nastrophysics is much like detector and instrument development at NASA. These\nefforts are necessary for the success of astronomical research being funded by\nNASA. Without concomitant efforts in all three directions (observational\nfacilities, detector/instrument development, and laboratory astrophysics) the\nfuture progress of astronomy and astrophysics is imperiled. In addition, new\ndevelopments in experimental technologies have allowed laboratory studies to\ntake on a new role as some questions which previously could only be studied\ntheoretically can now be addressed directly in the lab. With this in mind we,\nthe members of the AAS Working Group on Laboratory Astrophysics (WGLA), have\nprepared this White Paper on the laboratory astrophysics infrastructure needed\nto maximize the scientific return from NASA's space and Earth sciences program.",

This leads to an\nobservable difference in the pulse shape of the light detector, which can be\nused to tag these events.

Using empirical correlations and recent results of N-body simulations,\nall the free parameters of the models are expressed as functions of one single\nquantity: the total (B-band) luminosity of the stellar component.\n  We analyze how to perform discrete N-body realizations of Sersic models. To\nthis end, an optimal smoothing length is derived, defined as the softening\nparameter minimizing the error on the gravitational potential for the\ndeprojected Sersic model. It is shown to depend on the Sersic index $n$ and on\nthe number of particles of the N-body realization.\n  A software code allowing the computations of the relevant quantities of one-\nand two-component Sersic models is provided. Both the code and the results of\nthe present work are primarily intended as tools to perform N-body simulations\nof early-type galaxies, where the structural non-homology of these systems\n(i.e. the variation of the shape parameter along the galaxy sequence) might be\ntaken into account.",

This framework generates simulations of\ncomplete missions, with varying populations of planets, to produce ensembles of\nmission simulations, which are used to calculate distributions of mission\nscience yields. We describe the components of a mission simulation, including\nthe complete description of an arbitrary planetary system, the description of a\nplanet finding instrument, and the modeling of a target system observation.\nThese components are coupled with a decision modeling algorithm, which allows\nus to automatically generate mission timelines with simple mission rules that\nlead to an optimized science yield. Along with the details of our\nimplementation of this algorithm, we discuss validation techniques and possible\nfuture refinements. We apply this analysis technique to four mission concepts\nwhose common element is a 4m diameter telescope aperture: an internal pupil\nmapping coronagraph with two different inner working angles, an external\nocculter, and the THEIA XPC multiple distance occulter. The focus of this study\nis to determine the ability of each of these designs to achieve one of their\nmost difficult mission goals - the detection and characterization of Earth-like\nplanets in the habitable zone. We find that all four designs are capable of\ndetecting on the order of 5 Earth-like planets within a 5 year mission, even if\nwe assume that only 1 out of every 10 stars has such a planet. The designs do\ndiffer significantly in their ability to characterize the planets they find.\nAlong with science yield, we also analyze fuel usage for the two occulter\ndesigns, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of the mission\nconcepts.",

Previous studies have found that line-of-sight\napproaches are capable of cleaning foregrounds to an acceptable level on large\nspatial scales, but not on small spatial scales. In this paper, we introduce a\nFourier-space formalism for describing the line-of-sight methods, and use it to\nintroduce an improved new method for 21 cm foreground cleaning. Heuristically,\nthis method involves fitting foregrounds in Fourier space using weighted\npolynomial fits, with each pixel weighted according to its information content.\nWe show that the new method reproduces the old one on large angular scales, and\ngives marked improvements on small scales at essentially no extra computational\ncost.",

We\npresent in this paper the first laboratory demonstration of a high efficiency\nPIAA-type coronagraph on such a pupil, using coronagraphic optics which will be\npart of the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme-AO (SCExAO) system currently under\nassembly. Lossless pupil apodization is performed by a set of aspheric PIAA\nlenses specifically designed to also remove the pupil's central obstruction,\ncoupled with a Spider Removal Plate (SRP) which removes spider vanes by\ntranslating four parts of the pupil with tilted plane-parallel plates. An\n\"inverse-PIAA\" system, located after the coronagraphic focal plane mask, is\nused to remove off-axis aberrations and deliver a wide field of view.\n  Our results validate the concept adopted for the SCExAO system, and show that\nthe Subaru Telescope pupil can properly be apodized for high contrast\ncoronagraphic imaging as close as $\\approx$ 1 $\\lambda/D$ with no loss of\nsensitivity. We also verify that off-axis aberrations in the system are in\nagreement with theory, and that the inverse PIAA system recovers a wide usable\nfield of view for exoplanet detection and disks imaging.",

        "title": "Astrophysical Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics",
        "summary": "The paper presents a detailed review of the smooth particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH) method with particular focus on its astrophysical applications. We start\nby introducing the basic ideas and concepts and thereby outline all ingredients\nthat are necessary for a practical implementation of the method in a working\nSPH code. Much of SPH's success relies on its excellent conservation properties\nand therefore the numerical conservation of physical invariants receives much\nattention throughout this review. The self-consistent derivation of the SPH\nequations from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid is the common theme of the\nremainder of the text. We derive a modern, Newtonian SPH formulation from the\nLagrangian of an ideal fluid. It accounts for changes of the local resolution\nlengths which result in corrective, so-called \"grad-h-terms\". We extend this\nstrategy to special relativity for which we derive the corresponding grad-h\nequation set. The variational approach is further applied to a\ngeneral-relativistic fluid evolving in a fixed, curved background space-time.\nParticular care is taken to explicitely derive all relevant equations in a\ncoherent way.",

        "summary": "A movement is underway to test the uniqueness of Earth. Sponsored primarily\nby NASA, it is enlisting talented researchers from many disciplines. It is\nconceiving new telescopes to discover and characterize other worlds like Earth\naround nearby stars and to obtain their spectra. The goal is to search for\nsigns of biological activity and perhaps find other cradles of life.\n  Most effort thus far has focused on the optics to make such observations\nfeasible. Relatively little attention has been paid to science operations--the\nlink between instrument and science. Because of the special challenges\npresented by extrasolar planets, science-operational issues may be limiting\nfactors for the \"Are We Alone?\" (AWA) movement. Science-operational metrics can\nhelp compare the merits of direct and astrometric planet searches, and estimate\nthe concatenated completeness of searching followed by spectroscopy. This\ncompleteness is the prime science metric of the AWA program. Therefore, the\ngoals of this white paper are to present representative calculations involving\nscience-operational metrics, and to promote a science-operational perspective.\nWe urge the Survey Committee to allow this perspective and such metrics to\ninform its plan for the future of AWA.",

        "summary": "The emission of warm dust dominates the mid-infrared spectra of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). Only interferometric observations provide the necessary\nangular resolution to resolve the nuclear dust and to study its distribution\nand properties. The investigation of dust in AGN cores is hence one of the main\nscience goals for the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument MIDI at the VLTI.\nAs the first step, the feasibility of AGN observations was verified and the\nmost promising sources for detailed studies were identified. This was carried\nout in a \"snapshot survey\" with MIDI using Guaranteed Time Observations. In the\nsurvey, observations were attempted for 13 of the brightest AGN in the\nmid-infrared which are visible from Paranal. The results of the three\nbrightest, best studied sources have been published in separate papers. Here we\npresent the interferometric observations for the remaining 10, fainter AGN. For\n8 of these, interferometric measurements could be carried out. Size estimates\nor limits on the spatial extent of the AGN-heated dust were derived from the\ninterferometric data of 7 AGN. These indicate that the dust distributions are\ncompact, with sizes on the order of a few parsec. The derived sizes roughly\nscale with the square root of the luminosity in the mid-infrared, s ~ sqrt(L),\nwith no clear distinction between type 1 and type 2 objects. This is in\nagreement with a model of nearly optically thick dust structures heated to T ~\n300 K. For three sources, the 10 micron feature due to silicates is tentatively\ndetected either in emission or in absorption. Based on the results for all AGN\nstudied with MIDI so far, we conclude that in the mid-infrared the differences\nbetween individual galactic nuclei are greater than the generic differences\nbetween type 1 and type 2 objects.",

We use dynamical survival models to construct a plausible example of a\nplanetesimal disk and study its microlensing properties using established ideas\nof microlensing by small bodies. When a solar-type source star passes behind a\nplanetesimal disk, the microlensing light curve may exhibit short-term,\nlow-amplitude residuals caused by planetesimals several orders of magnitude\nbelow Earth mass. The minimum planetesimal mass probed depends on the\nphotometric sensitivity and the size of the source star, and is lower when the\nplanetesimal lens is located closer to us. Planetesimal lenses may be found\nmore nearby than stellar lenses because the steepness of the planetesimal mass\ndistribution changes how the microlensing signal depends on the lens/source\ndistance ratio. Microlensing searches for planetesimals require essentially\ncontinuous monitoring programs that are already feasible and can potentially\nset constraints on models of debris disks, the supposed extrasolar analogues of\nKuiper belts.",

        "summary": "We present Stellar Locus Regression (SLR), a method of directly adjusting the\ninstrumental broadband optical colors of stars to bring them into accord with a\nuniversal stellar color-color locus, producing accurately calibrated colors for\nboth stars and galaxies. This is achieved without first establishing individual\nzeropoints for each passband, and can be performed in real-time at the\ntelescope. We demonstrate how SLR naturally makes one wholesale correction for\ndifferences in instrumental response, for atmospheric transparency, for\natmospheric extinction, and for Galactic extinction. We perform an example SLR\ntreatment of SDSS data over a wide range of Galactic dust values and\nindependently recover the direction and magnitude of the canonical Galactic\nreddening vector with 14--18 mmag RMS uncertainties. We then isolate the effect\nof atmospheric extinction, showing that SLR accounts for this and returns\nprecise colors over a wide of airmass, with 5--14 mmag RMS residuals. We\ndemonstrate that SLR-corrected colors are sufficiently accurate to allow\nphotometric redshift estimates for galaxy clusters (using red sequence\ngalaxies) with an uncertainty sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.6% per cluster for redshifts\n0.09<z<0.25. Finally, we identify our objects in the 2MASS all-sky catalog, and\nproduce i-band zeropoints typically accurate to 18 mmag using only SLR.

        "title": "Stroke saturation on a MEMS deformable mirror for woofer-tweeter\n  adaptive optics",
        "summary": "High-contrast imaging of extrasolar planet candidates around a main-sequence\nstar has recently been realized from the ground using current adaptive optics\n(AO) systems. Advancing such observations will be a task for the Gemini Planet\nImager, an upcoming \"extreme\" AO instrument. High-order \"tweeter\" and low-order\n\"woofer\" deformable mirrors (DMs) will supply a >90%-Strehl correction, a\nspecialized coronagraph will suppress the stellar flux, and any planets can\nthen be imaged in the \"dark hole\" region. Residual wavefront error scatters\nlight into the DM-controlled dark hole, making planets difficult to image above\nthe noise. It is crucial in this regard that the high-density tweeter, a\nmicro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) DM, have sufficient stroke to deform\nto the shapes required by atmospheric turbulence. Laboratory experiments were\nconducted to determine the rate and circumstance of saturation, i.e. stroke\ninsufficiency. A 1024-actuator 1.5-um-stroke MEMS device was empirically tested\nwith software Kolmogorov-turbulence screens of r_0=10-15cm. The MEMS when\nsolitary suffered saturation ~4% of the time. Simulating a woofer DM with ~5-10\nactuators across a 5-m primary mitigated MEMS saturation occurrence to a\nfraction of a percent. While no adjacent actuators were saturated at opposing\npositions, mid-to-high-spatial-frequency stroke did saturate more frequently\nthan expected, implying that correlations through the influence functions are\nimportant. Analytical models underpredict the stroke requirements, so empirical\nstudies are important.",

        "summary": "We have constructed a moderately large area (32 cm2), fine pixel (2.5 mm\npixel, 5 mm thick) CZT imaging detector which constitutes the first section of\na detector module (256 cm2) developed for a balloon-borne wide-field hard X-ray\ntelescope, ProtoEXIST1. ProtoEXIST1 is a prototype for the High Energy\nTelescope (HET) in the Energetic X-ray imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST), a next\ngeneration space-borne multi-wavelength telescope. We have constructed a large\n(nearly gapless) detector plane through a modularization scheme by tiling of a\nlarge number of 2 cm x 2 cm CZT crystals. Our innovative packaging method is\nideal for many applications such as coded-aperture imaging, where a large,\ncontinuous detector plane is desirable for the optimal performance. Currently\nwe have been able to achieve an energy resolution of 3.2 keV (FWHM) at 59.6 keV\non average, which is exceptional considering the moderate pixel size and the\nnumber of detectors in simultaneous operation. We expect to complete two\nmodules (512 cm2) within the next few months as more CZT becomes available. We\nplan to test the performance of these detectors in a near space environment in\na series of high altitude balloon flights, the first of which is scheduled for\nFall 2009. These detector modules are the first in a series of progressively\nmore sophisticated detector units and packaging schemes planned for ProtoEXIST2\n& 3, which will demonstrate the technology required for the advanced CZT\nimaging detectors (0.6 mm pixel, 4.5 m2 area) required in EXIST/HET.",

Pairwise annihilation of neutralinos,\npredicted by some supersymmetric extensions to the standard model of particle\nphysics, may leave a distinct feature in the cosmic-ray positron spectrum.\n  As the available data are limited both in terms of statistics and energy\nrange, we are developing a balloon-borne detector (PEBS) with a large\nacceptance of 4000 cm^2 sr. A superconducting magnet creating a field of 0.8 T\nand a tracking device consisting of scintillating fibers of 0.25 mm diameter\nwith silicon photomultiplier readout will allow rigidity and charge\ndetermination to energies above 100 GeV. The dominant proton background is\nsuppressed by the combination of an electromagnetic calorimeter and a\ntransition radiation detector consisting of fleece layers interspersed with\nstraw-tube proportional counters. The calorimeter uses a sandwich of tungsten\nand scintillating fibers that are again read out by silicon photomultipliers.",

To investigate the\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for these processes in stars with similar\nlocations in the H-R diagram, an accurate abundance determination is needed,\namong others. Here, we describe a semi-automatic procedure developed to\ndetermine chemical abundances of various elements ranging from helium to\nmercury for this type of stars. We test our procedure on synthetic spectra,\ndemonstrating that our procedure provides abundances consistent with the input\nvalues, even when the stellar parameters are offset by reasonable observational\nerrors. For a fast-rotating star such as Vega, our analysis is consistent with\nthose carried out with other plane-parallel model atmospheres. Simulations show\nthat the offsets from the input abundances increase for stars with low\ninclination angle of about 4 degrees. For this inclination angle, we also show\nthat the distribution of the iron abundance found in different regions is\nbimodal. Furthermore, the effect of rapid rotation can be seen in the peculiar\nbehaviour of the H_beta line.",

The proposed methodology creates\nintegrators with zero phase lag in a test Lagrangian in a similar way used in\nphase fitted numerical methods for ordinary differential equations.

The results show that the new method\ndramatically improves the accuracy and total energy behaviour in Hamiltonian\nsystems. Numerical tests for the 2-body problem with ultra high eccentricity up\nto 0.99 for 1000000 periods and to the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian system with\nchaotic behaviour, show the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

        "summary": "Current projects for large telescopes demand a proper knowledge of\natmospheric turbulence to design efficient adaptive optics systems in order to\nreach large Strehl ratios. However, the proper characterization of the\nturbulence above a particular site requires long-term monitoring. Due to the\nlack of long-term information on turbulence, high-altitude winds (in particular\nwinds at the 200 mbar pressure level) were proposed as a parameter for\nestimating the total turbulence at a particular site, with the advantage of\nrecords of winds going back several decades. We present the first complete\nstudy of atmospheric adaptive optics parameters above the Teide Observatory\n(Canary Islands, Spain) in relation to wind speed. On-site measurements of\nCN2(h) profiles (more than 20200 turbulence profiles) from G-SCIDAR\nobservations and wind vertical profiles from balloons have been used to\ncalculate the seeing, the isoplanatic angle and the coherence time. The\nconnection of these parameters to wind speeds at ground and 200 mbar pressure\nlevel are shown and discussed. Our results confirm the well-known high quality\nof the Canary Islands astronomical observatories.",

Stars almost\ncertainly form from gravitational collapse and probably have formed this way\nsince the first stars lit the skies. Although it is possible that planets form\nin this way also, processes involving accretion in a circumstellar disk have\nbeen favored. High fidelity high resolution images may resolve the question;\nboth processes may occur in some mass ranges. The questions to be answered in\nthe next decade include:\n  By what process do planets form, and how does the mode of formation determine\nthe character of planetary systems?\n  What is the distribution of masses of planets? In what manner does the\nmetallicity of the parent star influence the character of its planetary system?\n  In this paper we discuss the observations of planetary systems from birth to\nmaturity, with an emphasis on observations longward of 100 $\\mu$m which may\nilluminate the character of their formation and evolution. Advantages of this\nspectral region include lower opacity, availability of extremely high\nresolution to reach planet formation scales and to perform precision astrometry\nand high sensitivity to thermal emission.",

This method is based on two simple real functions for which\nthe derivative rules are only required to be known, all other applications --\ne.g., calculating the orbital velocities, obtaining the partial derivatives of\nradial velocity curves with respect to the orbital elements -- are thereafter\nstraightforward.

        "summary": "Until recently, it has been possible only for nearby galaxies to study the\nscaling relations between central black hole and host galaxy in detail. Because\nof the small number densities at low redshift, (luminous) AGN are\nunderrepresented in such detailed studies. The advent of adaptive optics (AO)\nat large telescopes helps overcoming this hurdle, allowing to reach small\nlinear scales over a wide range in redshift. Finding AO-suitable targets, i.e.,\nAGN having a nearby reference star, and carrying out an initial multiwavelength\nclassification is an excellent use case for the Virtual Observatory. We present\nour Virtual-Observatory approach to select an AO-suitable catalog of\nX-ray-emitting AGN at redshifts 0.1<z<1.",

        "summary": "We present the exact calculus of the gravitational potential and acceleration\nalong the symmetry axis of a plane, homogeneous, polar cell as a function of\nmean radius a, radial extension e, and opening angle f. Accurate approximations\nare derived in the limit of high numerical resolution at the geometrical mean\n<a> of the inner and outer radii (a key-position in current FFT-based Poisson\nsolvers). Our results are the full extension of the approximate formula given\nin the textbook of Binney & Tremaine to all resolutions. We also clarify\ndefinitely the question about the existence (or not) of self-forces in polar\ncells. We find that there is always a self-force at radius <a> except if the\nshape factor a.f/e reaches ~ 3.531, asymptotically. Such cells are therefore\nwell suited to build a polar mesh for high resolution simulations of\nself-gravitating media in two dimensions. A by-product of this study is a newly\ndiscovered indefinite integral involving complete elliptic integral of the\nfirst kind over modulus.",

        "summary": "Direct inversion of incomplete visibility samples in VLBI (Very Large\nBaseline Interferometry) radio telescopes produces images with convolutive\nartifacts. Since proper analysis and interpretations of astronomical radio\nsources require a non-distorted image, and because filling all of sampling\npoints in the uv-plane is an impossible task, image deconvolution has been one\nof central issues in the VLBI imaging. Up to now, the most widely used\ndeconvolution algorithms are based on least-squares-optimization and maximum\nentropy method. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that is based on an\nemerging paradigm called compressive sensing (CS). Under the sparsity\ncondition, CS capable to exactly reconstructs a signal or an image, using only\na few number of random samples. We show that CS is well-suited with the VLBI\nimaging problem and demonstrate that the proposed method is capable to\nreconstruct a simulated image of radio galaxy from its incomplete visibility\nsamples taken from elliptical trajectories in the uv-plane. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method is also demonstrated with an actual VLBI measured data\nof 3C459 asymmetric radio-galaxy observed by the VLA (Very Large Array).",

Nevertheless,\nrecent discoveries from limited surveys and serendipitous discoveries indicate\nthat there is much to be found on timescales from nanoseconds to years and at\nwavelengths from meters to millimeters. These observations have revealed\nunexpected phenomena such as rotating radio transients and coherent pulses from\nbrown dwarfs. Additionally, archival studies have found not-yet identified\nradio transients without optical or high-energy hosts. In addition to the known\nclasses of radio transients, possible other classes of objects include\nextrapolations from known classes and exotica such as orphan gamma-ray burst\nafterglows, radio supernovae, tidally-disrupted stars, flare stars, magnetars,\nand transmissions from extraterrestrial civilizations.\n  Over the next decade, meter- and centimeter-wave radio telescopes with\nimproved sensitivity, wider fields of view, and flexible digital signal\nprocessing will be able to explore radio transient parameter space more\ncomprehensively and systematically.",

        "summary": "Observational astronomy has changed drastically in the last decade: manually\ndriven target-by-target instruments have been replaced by fully automated\nrobotic telescopes. Data acquisition methods have advanced to the point that\nterabytes of data are flowing in and being stored on a daily basis.

To bridge this gap, we foresee that the next decade\nwill witness a fundamental shift in the approaches to data analysis:\ncase-by-case methods will be replaced by fully automated pipelines that will\nprocess the data from their reduction stage, through analysis, to storage.\nWhile major effort has been invested in data reduction automation, automated\ndata analysis has mostly been neglected despite the urgent need. Scientific\ndata mining will face serious challenges to identify, understand and eliminate\nthe sources of systematic errors that will arise from this automation.

        "summary": "Astrometry can detect rocky planets in a broad range of masses and orbital\ndistances and measure their masses and three-dimensional orbital parameters,\nincluding eccentricity and inclination, to provide the properties of\nterrestrial planets. The masses of both the new planets and the known gas\ngiants can be measured unambiguously, allowing a direct calculation of the\ngravitational interactions, both past and future. Such dynamical interactions\ninform theories of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, including\nEarth-like planets. Astrometry is the only technique technologically ready to\ndetect planets of Earth mass in the habitable zone (HZ) around solar-type stars\nwithin 20 pc. These Earth analogs are close enough for follow-up observations\nto characterize the planets by infrared imaging and spectroscopy with planned\nfuture missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the\nTerrestrial Planet Finder/Darwin. Employing a demonstrated astrometric\nprecision of 1 microarcsecond and a noise floor under 0.1 micro-arcseconds, SIM\nLite can make multiple astrometric measurements of the nearest 60 F-, G-, and\nK-type stars during a five-year mission. SIM Lite directly tests theories of\nrocky planet formation and evolution around Sun-like stars and identifies the\nnearest potentially habitable planets for later spaceborne imaging, e.g., with\nTerrestrial Planet Finder and Darwin. SIM was endorsed by the two recent\nDecadal Surveys and it meets the highest-priority goal of the 2008 AAAC\nExoplanet Task Force.",

        "summary": "The Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) is a set of\nmission concepts for the next generation of UVOIR space observatory with a\nprimary aperture diameter in the 8-m to 16-m range that will allow us to\nperform some of the most challenging observations to answer some of our most\ncompelling questions, including \"Is there life elsewhere in the Galaxy?\" We\nhave identified two different telescope architectures, but with similar optical\ndesigns, that span the range in viable technologies. The architectures are a\ntelescope with a monolithic primary mirror and two variations of a telescope\nwith a large segmented primary mirror. This approach provides us with several\npathways to realizing the mission, which will be narrowed to one as our\ntechnology development progresses. The concepts invoke heritage from HST and\nJWST design, but also take significant departures from these designs to\nminimize complexity, mass, or both.\n  Our report provides details on the mission concepts, shows the extraordinary\nscientific progress they would enable, and describes the most important\ntechnology development items. These are the mirrors, the detectors, and the\nhigh-contrast imaging technologies, whether internal to the observatory, or\nusing an external occulter. Experience with JWST has shown that determined\ncompetitors, motivated by the development contracts and flight opportunities of\nthe new observatory, are capable of achieving huge advances in technical and\noperational performance while keeping construction costs on the same scale as\nprior great observatories.",

        "summary": "The onset of runaway stellar collisions in young star clusters is more likely\nto initiate with an encounter between a binary and a third star than between\ntwo single stars. Using the initial conditions of such three-star encounters\nfrom direct $N$-body simulations, we model the resulting interaction by means\nof Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We find that, in the majority of the\ncases considered, all three stars merge together, and in such three star\nmergers, the hydrodynamic simulations reveal that: (1) mass lost as ejecta can\nbe a considerable fraction of the total mass in the system (up to $\\sim25$%);\n(2) due to asymmetric mass loss, the collision product can sometimes receive a\nkick velocity that exceeds 10 km/s, large enough to allow the collision product\nto escape the core of the cluster; and (3) the energy of the ejected matter can\nbe large enough (up to $\\sim 3\\times 10^{50}$ erg) to remove or disturb the\ninter cluster gas appreciably.",

In this paper, we review the\nproperties of the main samples that are currently available, both selected on\nthe basis of spectral index and of morphology. As a result of the work in this\narea, large numbers of intrinsically small sources have been found. We\nsummarize the present status of hot spot advance measurements, listing 18\nsources with available VLBI data. The mean hot spot separation velocity is\nv_{sep} = (0.19 +/- 0.11)h^{-1}c and the kinematic ages span the range from 20\nto 3000 years. Finally, we present a brief outlook on the use of future\ninstrumentation in order to improve our understanding of radio source\nevolution.

Indirect methods, that measure the effect of a\nplanet on its host star, are much more promising and have indeed led to the\ndiscovery of nearly all extrasolar systems known today. While the most\nsuccessful method thus far is the radial velocity technique, new\ninterferometric instruments like PRIMA at the VLTI will enable us to carry out\nastrometric measurements accurate enough to detect extrasolar planets and to\ndetermine all orbital parameters, including their orbit inclination and true\nmass. In this article I describe the narrow-angle astrometry technique, how it\nwill be realized with PRIMA, what kind of planets we can find, and what kind of\npreparatory observations are required.",

Background from the much\nmore numerous cosmic-ray cascades is efficiently reduced by considering the\nshape of the shower images, and the capability to reduce this background is one\nof the key aspects that determine the sensitivity of a IACT.

After outlining several instrument classes that are\nrelying on digital instrumentation development to achieve new science\nobjectives, we identify key areas where technologies pertaining to\ninteroperability and processing flexibility will reduce the time, risk, and\ncost of developing the digital instrumentation for radio astronomy. These areas\nrepresent focus points where support of general-purpose, open-source\ndevelopment for a DSP community should be prioritized in the next decade.\nContributors to such technological development may be centers of support for\nthis DSP community, science groups that contribute general-purpose DSP\nsolutions as part of their own instrumentation needs, or engineering groups\nengaging in research that may be applied to next-generation DSP\ninstrumentation.",

The array is designed to detect the coherent Askaryan radio emission from\nUHE neutrino interactions in the ice, with the goal of detecting the cosmogenic\nneutrino flux with reasonable event rates. Operating in coincidence with the\nIceCube neutrino detector would allow complete calorimetry of a subset of the\nevents.

        "title": "The Possible Impact of GRB Detector Thresholds on Cosmological Standard\n  Candles",
        "summary": "GRB satellites are relatively inefficient detectors of dim hard bursts\nbecause they trigger on photon counts, which are number-biased against hard\nphotons. Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity\nnear the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected\nover a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or skew an apparent\ncorrelation where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright. Although\nsuch correlations may be obfuscated by a middle step where GRBs need to be\nbright enough to have their actual redshifts determined, it is found that the\nbias is generally pervasive. This result is derived here through simulations\nconvolving a wide variety of possible GRB brightnesses and spectra with the\nBATSE Large Area Detectors (LAD) detection thresholds. The presented analyses\nindicate that the rest-frame $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectrum peak energy of\nlong-duration GRBs, $\\epi$, is not a good cosmological standard candle without\nsignificant corrections for selection effects. Therefore, the appearance of\n$\\epi$ in seeming correlations such as the Amati ($E_{iso}-\\epi$), Ghirlanda\n($E_{\\gamma}-\\epi$), and $L_{iso}-\\epi$ relations is statistically real but\nstrongly influenced by so far uncalibrated GRB detector thresholds.",

        "summary": "We describe an application of the MultiNest algorithm to gravitational wave\ndata analysis. MultiNest is a multimodal nested sampling algorithm designed to\nefficiently evaluate the Bayesian evidence and return posterior probability\ndensities for likelihood surfaces containing multiple secondary modes. The\nalgorithm employs a set of live points which are updated by partitioning the\nset into multiple overlapping ellipsoids and sampling uniformly from within\nthem. This set of live points climbs up the likelihood surface through nested\niso-likelihood contours and the evidence and posterior distributions can be\nrecovered from the point set evolution. The algorithm is model-independent in\nthe sense that the specific problem being tackled enters only through the\nlikelihood computation, and does not change how the live point set is updated.\nIn this paper, we consider the use of the algorithm for gravitational wave data\nanalysis by searching a simulated LISA data set containing two non-spinning\nsupermassive black hole binary signals. The algorithm is able to rapidly\nidentify all the modes of the solution and recover the true parameters of the\nsources to high precision.",

        "title": "A Bayesian Assessment of P-Values for Significance Estimation of Power\n  Spectra and an Alternative Procedure, with Application to Solar Neutrino Data",
        "summary": "The usual procedure for estimating the significance of a peak in a power\nspectrum is to calculate the probability of obtaining that value or a larger\nvalue by chance (known as the \"p-value\"), on the assumption that the time\nseries contains only noise - typically that the measurements are derived from\nrandom samplings of a Gaussian distribution. We really need to know the\nprobability that the time series is - or is not - compatible with the null\nhypothesis that the measurements are derived from noise. This probability can\nbe calculated by Bayesian analysis, but this requires one to specify and\nevaluate a second hypothesis, that the time series does contain a contribution\nother than noise. We approach the problem of identifying this function in two\nways. We first propose three simple conditions that it seems reasonable to\nimpose on this function, and show that these conditions may be satisfied by a\nsimple function with one free parameter. We then define two different ways of\ncombining information derived from two independent power estimates. We find\nthat this consistency condition may be satisfied, to good approximation, by a\nspecial case of the previously proposed likelihood function. We find that the\nresulting significance estimates are considerably more conservative than those\nusually associated with the p-values. As two examples, we apply the new\nprocedure to two recent analyses of solar neutrino data: (a) power spectrum\nanalysis of Super-Kamiokande data, and (b) the combined analysis of\nradiochemical neutrino data and irradiance data.",

        "summary": "The results on the vertical distribution of optical turbulence above the five\nmountains which were investigated by the site testing for the Thirty Meter\nTelescope (TMT) are reported. On San Pedro Martir in Mexico, the 13 North site\non Mauna Kea and three mountains in northern Chile Cerro Tolar, Cerro Armazones\nand Cerro Tolonchar, MASS-DIMM turbulence profilers have been operated over at\nleast two years. Acoustic turbulence profilers - SODARs - were also operated at\nthese sites. The obtained turbulence profiles indicate that at all sites the\nlowest 200m are the main source of the total seeing observed, with the Chilean\nsites showing a weaker ground layer than the other two sites. The two northern\nhemisphere sites have weaker turbulence at altitudes above 500m, with 13N\nshowing the weakest 16km turbulence, being responsible for the large\nisoplanatic angle at this site. The influence of the jetstream and wind speeds\nclose to the ground on the clear sky turbulence strength throughout the\natmosphere are discussed, as well as seasonal and nocturnal variations. This is\nthe sixth article in a series discussing the TMT site testing project.",

        "title": "Magnetic fields of non-degenerate stars",
        "summary": "Magnetic fields are present in a wide variety of stars throughout the HR\ndiagram and play a role at basically all evolutionary stages, from\nvery-low-mass dwarfs to very massive stars, and from young star-forming\nmolecular clouds and protostellar accretion discs to evolved giants/supergiants\nand magnetic white dwarfs/neutron stars. These fields range from a few microG\n(e.g., in molecular clouds) to TeraG and more (e.g., in magnetic neutron\nstars); in non-degenerate stars in particular, they feature large-scale\ntopologies varying from simple nearly-axisymmetric dipoles to complex\nnon-axsymmetric structures, and from mainly poloidal to mainly toroidal\ntopology. After recalling the main techniques of detecting and modelling\nstellar magnetic fields, we review the existing properties of magnetic fields\nreported in cool, hot and young non-degenerate stars and protostars, and\ndiscuss our understanding of the origin of these fields and their impact on the\nbirth and life of stars.",

        "title": "Large Focal Plane Arrays for Future Missions",
        "summary": "We outline the challenges associated with the development and construction of\nlarge focal plane arrays for use both on the ground and in space. Using lessons\nlearned from existing JPL-led and ASU/JPL partnership efforts to develop\ntechnology for, and design such arrays and imagers for large focal planes, we\nenumerate here the remaining problems that need to be solved to make such a\nventure viable. Technologies we consider vital for further development include:\n(1) architectures, processes, circuits, and readout solutions for production\nand integration of four-side buttable, low-cost, high-fidelity,\nhigh-performance, and high-reliability CCD and CMOS imagers; (2) modular,\nfour-side buttable packaging of CCD/CMOS imagers; (3) techniques and hardware\nto test and characterize the large number of chips required to produce the\nhundreds of flight-grade detectors needed for large focal-plane missions being\nconceived at this time; (4) ground based testbed needs, such as a large format\ncamera mounted on a ground-based telescope, to field test the detectors and the\nfocal plane technology solutions; and (5) validation of critical sub-components\nof the design on a balloon mission to ensure their flight-readiness. This paper\noutlines the steps required to provide a mature solution to the astronomical\ncommunity with a minimal investment, building on years of planning and\ninvestments already completed at JPL.",

SFC will deliver\ndiffraction-limited images at lambda > 300 nm in both a blue (190-517nm) and a\nred (517-1075nm) channel simultaneously. Our aim is to conduct a comprehensive\nand systematic study of the astrophysical processes and environments relevant\nfor the births and life cycles of stars and their planetary systems, and to\ninvestigate and understand the range of environments, feedback mechanisms, and\nother factors that most affect the outcome of the star and planet formation\nprocess. This program addresses the origins and evolution of stars, galaxies,\nand cosmic structure and has direct relevance for the formation and survival of\nplanetary systems like our Solar System and planets like Earth. We present the\ndesign and performance specifications resulting from the implementation study\nof the camera, conducted under NASA's Astrophysics Strategic Mission Concept\nStudies program, which is intended to assemble realistic options for mission\ndevelopment over the next decade. The result is an extraordinarily capable\ninstrument that will provide deep, high-resolution imaging across a very wide\nfield enabling a great variety of community science as well as completing the\ncore survey science that drives the design of the camera. The technology\nassociated with the camera is next generation but still relatively high TRL,\nallowing a low-risk solution with moderate technology development investment\nover the next 10 years. We estimate the cost of the instrument to be $390M\nFY08.",

        "summary": "The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on--board the Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope\nbegan its on--orbit operations on June 23, 2008. Calibrations, defined in a\ngeneric sense, correspond to synchronization of trigger signals, optimization\nof delays for latching data, determination of detector thresholds, gains and\nresponses, evaluation of the perimeter of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA),\nmeasurements of live time, of absolute time, and internal and spacecraft\nboresight alignments. Here we describe on orbit calibration results obtained\nusing known astrophysical sources, galactic cosmic rays, and charge injection\ninto the front-end electronics of each detector. Instrument response functions\nwill be described in a separate publication. This paper demonstrates the\nstability of calibrations and describes minor changes observed since launch.\nThese results have been used to calibrate the LAT datasets to be publicly\nreleased in August 2009.",

The Fermi LAT team\npursues complementary searches for signatures of particle Dark Matter in\ndifferent search regions such as the galactic center, galactic satellites and\nsubhalos, the milky way halo, extragalactic regions as well as the search for\nspectral lines. In these proceedings we examine the potential of the LAT to\ndetect gamma-rays coming from Weakly Interacting Massive Particle annihilations\nin these regions with special focus on the galactic center region.",

        "summary": "Ultra-high energy cosmic rays generate extensive air showers in Earth's\natmosphere. A standard approach to reconstruct the energy of an ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays is to sample the lateral profile of the particle density on\nthe ground of the air shower with an array of surface detectors. For cosmic\nrays with large inclinations, this reconstruction is based on a model of the\nlateral profile of the muon density observed on the ground, which is fitted to\nthe observed muon densities in individual surface detectors. The best models\nfor this task are derived from detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the air\nshower development. We present a phenomenological parametrization scheme which\nallows to derive a model of the average lateral profile of the muon density\ndirectly from a fit to a set of individual Monte-Carlo simulated air showers.\nThe model reproduces the detailed simulations with a high precision. As an\nexample, we generate a muon density model which is valid in the energy range\n1e18 eV < E < 1e20 eV and the zenith angle range 60 deg < theta < 90 deg. We\nwill further demonstrate a way to speed up the simulation of such muon profiles\nby three orders of magnitude, if only the muons in the shower are of interest.",

We found that the angular size of the star at the wavelengths of CO\nand H2O absorption lines were up to twice as large as the continuum\nphotosphere. This size difference is attributable to the optically thick CO and\nH2O molecular layers surrounding the photosphere. This measurement is the first\ndirect differential spectroscopic imaging of stellar extension that resolves\nindividual molecular lines with high spectral-resolution observations.

Solving these\nproblems will require conscious engineering of our profession.

We apply this analysis to the different variants of the Allan\nvariance: the Overlapping Allan Variance, the Modified Allan variance, the\nHadamard Variance and the Overlapping Hadamard variance. Based on this analysis\nwe present a new method to compute a new estimator of the Allan Variance and\nits variants in the frequency domain. We show that the proposed frequency\ndomain equations are equivalent to extending the data by periodization in the\ntime domain. Like the Total Variance \\cite{totvar}, which is based on extending\nthe data manually in the time domain, our frequency domain variances estimators\nhave better statistics than the estimators of the classical variances in the\ntime domain. We demonstrate that the previous well-know equation that relates\nthe Allan Variance to the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) of continuous-time\nsignals is not valid for real world discrete-time measurements and we propose a\nnew equation that relates the Allan Variance to the PSD of the discrete-time\nsignals and that allows to compute the Allan variance and its different\nvariants in the frequency domain .",

        "title": "Keck Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics Monitoring of the M8+L7 Binary LHS\n  2397aAB: First Dynamical Mass Benchmark at the L/T Transition",
        "summary": "We present Keck LGS AO imaging and aperture masking observations of the M8+L7\nbinary LHS 2397aAB. Together with archival HST, Gemini-North, and VLT data, our\nobservations span 11.8 years of the binary's 14.2-year orbital period. We\ndetermine a total dynamical mass of 0.146+/-0.014 MSun (153+/-15 MJup). Using\nthe combined observational constraints of the total mass and individual\nluminosities, the Tucson (Lyon) evolutionary models give an age for the system\nof 1.6 Gyr (1.8 Gyr), consistent with its space motion. We also use these\nmodels to determine the mass ratio, giving individual masses of 0.0839+/-0.0011\nMSun (0.0848+/-0.0011 MSun) for LHS 2397aA and 0.061+/-0.013 MSun\n(0.060+/-0.010 MSun) for LHS 2397aB. Because LHS 2397aB is very close to the\ntheoretical mass-limit of lithium burning, measuring its lithium depletion\nwould uniquely test substellar models. We estimate a spectral type of L7+/-1\nfor LHS 2397aB, making it the first L/T transition object with a dynamical mass\ndetermination. This enables a precise estimate of its effective temperature\nfrom Tucson (Lyon) models of 1460+/-40 K (1440+/-40 K), which is 200 K higher\nthan estimates for young late-L companions but consistent with older late-L\nfield dwarfs, supporting the idea that the temperature of the L/T transition is\nsurface gravity dependent. Comparing our temperature estimate for LHS 2397aB to\nthose derived from spectral synthesis modeling for similar objects reveals\nconsistency between evolutionary and atmospheric models at the L/T transition,\ndespite the currently limited understanding of this phase of substellar\nevolution. Future dynamical masses for L/T binaries spanning a range of surface\ngravity and age will provide the next critical tests of substellar models at\nthe L/T transition.",

        "summary": "It has been recently demonstrated that integrated optics could enhance\naccuracy, stability, and ease of use of stellar interferometry techniques. The\nsubject of this thesis is the study of an optical component based on singlemode\nwaveguides for the coherent recombining of optical beams coming from four\ntelescopes. Proposed architecture provides a simultaneous an instantaneous\nmeasurement of complex visibility of interferometric signals of the six\npossible pairs of telescopes. The component is optimized for achromatic\nbehaviour over the H spectral transparency band of atmosphere and integrates an\noriginal achromatic phase shifter in order to obtain four phase quadrature\nstates of interferometric fringes. Optical characterisation results obtained on\ndevices realized by deposition and etching of silica layers on silicon\nsubstrate confirm theoretical predictions et enabled the study of more complex\ncomponents at the heart of second generation instrumentation projects of the\nVLTI (Very Large Telescope Interferometer) This study shows that proposed\narchitecture can be extended to J and K spectral bands, can be applied for the\nrecombination of beams coming from six and even eight telescopes and could also\nbe applied to realise a fringe tracker.",

        "summary": "This paper analyses 3.5 years of site testing data obtained at Dome C,\nAntarctica, based on measurements obtained with three DIMMs located at three\ndifferent elevations. Basic statistics of the seeing and the isoplanatic angle\nare given, as well as the characteristic time of temporal fluctuations of these\ntwo parameters, which we found to around 30 minutes at 8 m. The 3 DIMMs are\nexploited as a profiler of the surface layer, and provide a robust estimation\nof its statistical properties. It appears to have a very sharp upper limit\n(less than 1 m). The fraction of time spent by each telescope above the top of\nthe surface layer permits us to deduce a median height of between 23 m and 27\nm. The comparison of the different data sets led us to infer the statistical\nproperties of the free atmosphere seeing, with a median value of 0.36 arcsec.\nThe C_n^2 profile inside the surface layer is also deduced from the seeing data\nobtained during the fraction of time spent by the 3 telescopes inside this\nturbulence. Statistically, the surface layer, except during the 3-month summer\nseason, contributes to 95 percent of the total turbulence from the surface\nlevel, thus confirming the exceptional quality of the site above it.",

        "title": "Measurement of the scintillation time spectra and pulse-shape\n  discrimination of low-energy beta and nuclear recoils in liquid argon with\n  DEAP-1",
        "summary": "The DEAP-1 low-background liquid argon detector was used to measure\nscintillation pulse shapes of electron and nuclear recoil events and to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) down to an\nelectron-equivalent energy of 20 keV.\n  In the surface dataset using a triple-coincidence tag we found the fraction\nof beta events that are misidentified as nuclear recoils to be $<1.4\\times\n10^{-7}$ (90% C.L.) for energies between 43-86 keVee and for a nuclear recoil\nacceptance of at least 90%, with 4% systematic uncertainty on the absolute\nenergy scale. The discrimination measurement on surface was limited by nuclear\nrecoils induced by cosmic-ray generated neutrons. This was improved by moving\nthe detector to the SNOLAB underground laboratory, where the reduced background\nrate allowed the same measurement with only a double-coincidence tag.\n  The combined data set contains $1.23\\times10^8$ events. One of those, in the\nunderground data set, is in the nuclear-recoil region of interest. Taking into\naccount the expected background of 0.48 events coming from random pileup, the\nresulting upper limit on the electronic recoil contamination is\n$<2.7\\times10^{-8}$ (90% C.L.) between 44-89 keVee and for a nuclear recoil\nacceptance of at least 90%, with 6% systematic uncertainty on the absolute\nenergy scale.\n  We developed a general mathematical framework to describe PSD parameter\ndistributions and used it to build an analytical model of the distributions\nobserved in DEAP-1. Using this model, we project a misidentification fraction\nof approx. $10^{-10}$ for an electron-equivalent energy threshold of 15 keV for\na detector with 8 PE/keVee light yield. This reduction enables a search for\nspin-independent scattering of WIMPs from 1000 kg of liquid argon with a\nWIMP-nucleon cross-section sensitivity of $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$, assuming\nnegligible contribution from nuclear recoil backgrounds.",

        "summary": "It is currently common to use spatially unresolved multi-filter broad-band\nphotometry to determine the masses of individual stellar clusters (and hence\nthe cluster mass function, CMF). I analyze the stochastic effects introduced by\nthe sampling of the stellar initial mass function (SIMF) in the derivation of\nthe individual masses and the CMF and I establish that such effects are the\nlargest contributor to the observational uncertainties. An analytical solution,\nvalid in the limit where uncertainties are small, is provided to establish the\nrange of cluster masses over which the CMF slope can be obtained with a given\naccuracy. The validity of the analytical solution is extended to higher mass\nuncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations and the Gamma approximation. The\nvalue of the Poisson mass is calculated for a large range of ages and a variety\nof filters for solar-metallicity clusters measured with single-filter\nphotometry. A method that uses the code CHORIZOS is presented to simultaneously\nderive masses, ages, and extinctions. The classical method of using unweighted\nUBV photometry to simultaneously establish ages and extinctions of stellar\nclusters is found to be unreliable for clusters older than approx. 30 Ma, even\nfor relatively large cluster masses. On the other hand, augmenting the filter\nset to include longer-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter\nincreases the range of masses and ages that can be accurately measured with\nunresolved photometry. Nevertheless, a relatively large range of masses and\nages is found to be dominated by SIMF sampling effects that render the observed\nmasses useless, even when using UBVRIJHK photometry. A revision of some\nliterature results affected by these effects is presented and possible\nsolutions for future observations and analyses are suggested.",

This procedure, which is nonparametric, is\nbased on thresholding wavelet coefficients.

We\nshow that the MSVST can be used for detecting and characterizing astrophysical\nsources of high-energy gamma rays, using realistic simulated observations with\nthe Large Area Telescope (LAT). The LAT was launched in June 2008 on the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The MSVST algorithm is very fast relative to\ntraditional likelihood model fitting, and permits efficient detection across\nthe time dimension and immediate estimation of spectral properties.\nAstrophysical sources of gamma rays, especially active galaxies, are typically\nquite variable, and our current work may lead to a reliable method to quickly\ncharacterize the flaring properties of newly-detected sources.",

        "title": "UNICS - An Unified Instrument Control System for Small/Medium Sized\n  Astronomical Observatories",
        "summary": "Although the astronomy community is witnessing an era of large telescopes,\nsmaller and medium sized telescopes still maintain their utility being larger\nin numbers. In order to obtain better scientific outputs it is necessary to\nincorporate modern and advanced technologies to the back-end instruments and to\ntheir interfaces with the telescopes through various control processes. However\noften tight financial constraints on the smaller and medium size observatories\nlimit the scope and utility of these systems. Most of the time for every new\ndevelopment on the telescope the back-end control systems are required to be\nbuilt from scratch leading to high costs and efforts. Therefore a simple, low\ncost control system for small and medium size observatory needs to be developed\nto minimize the cost and efforts while going for the expansion of the\nobservatory. Here we report on the development of a modern, multipurpose\ninstrument control system UNICS (Unified Instrument Control System) to\nintegrate the controls of various instruments and devices mounted on the\ntelescope. UNICS consists of an embedded hardware unit called Common Control\nUnit (CCU) and Linux based data acquisition and User Interface. The Hardware of\nthe CCU is built around the Atmel make ATmega 128 micro-controller and is\ndesigned with a back-plane, Master Slave architecture. The Graphical User\nInterface (GUI) has been developed based on QT and the back end application\nsoftware is based on C/C++. UNICS provides feedback mechanisms which give the\noperator a good visibility and a quick-look display of the status and modes of\ninstruments. UNICS is being used for regular science observations since March\n2008 on 2m, f/10 IUCAA Telescope located at Girawali, Pune India.",

        "summary": "We derive analytic expressions, and approximate them in closed form, for the\neffective detection aperture for Cerenkov radio emission from ultra-high-energy\nneutrinos striking the Moon. The resulting apertures are in good agreement with\nrecent Monte Carlo simulations and support the conclusion of James & Protheroe\n(2009)that neutrino flux upper limits derived from the GLUE search (Gorham et\nal.2004) were too low by an order of magnitude. We also use our analytic\nexpressions to derive scaling laws for the aperture as a function of\nobservational and lunar parameters. We find that at low frequencies\ndownward-directed neutrinos always dominate, but at higher frequencies, the\ncontribution from upward-directed neutrinos becomes increasingly important,\nespecially at low neutrino energies. Detecting neutrinos from Earth near the\nGZK regime will likely require radio telescope arrays with extremely large\ncollecting area and hundreds of hour of exposure time. Higher energy neutrinos\nare most easily detected using lower frequencies. Lunar surface roughness is a\ndecisive factor for obtaining detections at higher frequencies and higher\nenergies.",

        "title": "Bayesian photometric redshifts with empirical training sets",
        "summary": "We combine in a single framework the two complementary benefits of\nchi^2-template fits and empirical training sets used e.g. in neural nets: chi^2\nis more reliable when its probability density functions (PDFs) are inspected\nfor multiple peaks, while empirical training is more accurate when calibration\nand priors of query data and training set match. We present a chi^2-empirical\nmethod that derives PDFs from empirical models as a subclass of kernel\nregression methods, and apply it to the SDSS DR5 sample of >75,000 QSOs, which\nis full of ambiguities. Objects with single-peak PDFs show <1% outliers, rms\nredshift errors <0.05 and vanishing redshift bias. At z>2.5, these figures are\n2x better. Outliers result purely from the discrete nature and limited size of\nthe model, and rms errors are dominated by the instrinsic variety of object\ncolours. PDFs classed as ambiguous provide accurate probabilities for\nalternative solutions and thus weights for using both solutions and avoiding\nneedless outliers. E.g., the PDFs predict 78.0% of the stronger peaks to be\ncorrect, which is true for 77.9% of them. Redshift incompleteness is common in\nfaint spectroscopic surveys and turns into a massive undetectable outlier risk\nabove other performance limitations, but we can quantify residual outlier risks\nstemming from size and completeness of the model. We propose a matched\nchi^2-error scale for noisy data and show that it produces correct error\nestimates and redshift distributions accurate within Poisson errors. Our method\ncan easily be applied to future large galaxy surveys, which will benefit from\nthe reliability in ambiguity detection and residual risk quantification.",

We computed a grid of evolutionary models with\nnon-standard mixing at several metallicities with the Toulouse-Geneva code for\na range of stellar masses assuming an error bar of +-50K in Teff. We choose the\nevolutionary model that reproduces accurately the observed low lithium\nabundances observed in the solar twins. Our best-fit model for each solar twin\nprovides a mass and age solution constrained by their Li content and Teff\ndetermination. HIP 56948 is the most likely solar-twin candidate at the present\ntime and our analysis infers a mass of 0.994 +- 0.004 Msun and an age of 4.71\n+-1.39 Gyr. Non-standard mixing is required to explain the low Li abundances\nobserved in solar twins. Li depletion due to additional mixing in solar twins\nis strongly mass dependent. An accurate lithium abundance measurement and\nnon-standard models provide more precise information about the age and mass\nmore robustly than determined by classical methods alone.",

The aim of this\nnote is to identify the reason for this error and to derive an extended formula\naccurate at the level of 1 \\muas as needed e.g. for Gaia.\n  The analytical parametrized post-post-Newtonian solution for light\npropagation derived by \\citet{report1} gives the solution for the boundary\nproblem with all analytical terms of order $\\OO4$ taken into account. Giving an\nanalytical upper estimates of each term we investigate which\npost-post-Newtonian terms may play a role for an observer in the solar system\nat the level of 1 \\muas. We conclude that only one post-post-Newtonian term\nremains important for this numerical accuracy and derive a simplified\nanalytical solution for the boundary problem for light propagation containing\nall the terms that are indeed relevant at the level of 1 \\muas. The derived\nanalytical solution has been verified using the results of a high-accuracy\nnumerical integration of differential equations of light propagation and found\nto be correct at the level well below 1 \\muas for arbitrary observer situated\nwithin the solar system.",

        "summary": "We present a statistical method for the photometric search of rare\nastronomical sources based on the weighted k-NN method. A metric is defined in\na multi-dimensional color-magnitude space based only on the photometric\nproperties of template sources and the photometric uncertainties of both\ntemplates and data, without the need to define ad-hoc color and magnitude cuts\nwhich could bias the search. The metric is defined as a function of two\nparameters, the number of neighbors k and a threshold distance D_th that can be\noptimized for maximum selection efficiency and completeness. We apply the\nmethod to the search of L and T dwarfs in the Spitzer Extragalactic First Look\nSurvey and the Bootes field of the Spitzer Shallow Survey, as well as to the\nsearch of sub-stellar mass companions around nearby stars. With high level of\ncompleteness, we confirm the absence of late-T dwarfs detected in at least two\nbands in the First Look Survey, and only one in the Shallow Survey (previously\ndiscovered by Stern et al. 2007). This result is in agreement with the expected\nstatistics for late-T dwarfs. One L/early-T candidate is found in the First\nLook Survey, and 3 in the Shallow Surveys, currently undergoing follow-up\nspectroscopic verification. Finally, we discuss the potential for brown dwarf\nsearches with this method in the Spitzer warm mission Exploration Science\nprograms.",

        "summary": "We present the characterization and calibration of the Slow-Scan observation\nmode of the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard the AKARI satellite. The FIS,\none of the two focal-plane instruments on AKARI, has four photometric bands\nbetween 50--180 um with two types of Ge:Ga array detectors. In addition to the\nAll-Sky Survey, FIS has also taken detailed far-infrared images of selected\ntargets by using the Slow-Scan mode. The sensitivity of the Slow-Scan mode is\none to two orders of magnitude better than that of the All-Sky Survey, because\nthe exposure time on a targeted source is much longer. The point spread\nfunctions (PSFs) were obtained by observing several bright point-like objects\nsuch as asteroids, stars, and galaxies. The derived full widths at the half\nmaximum (FWHMs) are ~30'' for the two shorter wavelength bands and ~40'' for\nthe two longer wavelength bands, being consistent with those expected by the\noptical simulation, although a certain amount of excess is seen in the tails of\nthe PSFs. The flux calibration has been performed by the observations of\nwell-established photometric calibration standards (asteroids and stars) in a\nwide range of fluxes. After establishing the method of aperture photometry, the\nphotometric accuracy for point-sources is better than +-15% in all of the bands\nexpect for the longest wavelength.",

        "summary": "There are several key open questions as to the nature and origin of AGN\nincluding: 1) what initiates the active phase, 2) the duration of the active\nphase, and 3) the effect of the AGN on the host galaxy. Critical new insights\nto these can be achieved by probing the central regions of AGN with sub-mas\nangular resolution at UV/optical wavelengths. In particular, such observations\nwould enable us to constrain the energetics of the AGN \"feedback\" mechanism,\nwhich is critical for understanding the role of AGN in galaxy formation and\nevolution. These observations can only be obtained by long-baseline\ninterferometers or sparse aperture telescopes in space, since the aperture\ndiameters required are in excess of 500 m - a regime in which monolithic or\nsegmented designs are not and will not be feasible and because these\nobservations require the detection of faint emission near the bright unresolved\ncontinuum source, which is impossible from the ground, even with adaptive\noptics. Two mission concepts which could provide these invaluable observations\nare NASA's Stellar Imager (SI; Carpenter et al. 2008 &\nhttp://hires.gsfc.nasa.gov/si/) interferometer and ESA's Luciola (Labeyrie\n2008) sparse aperture hypertelescope.",

Classical\nNyquist criterion to estimate frequency range which is potentially recoverable\nmust be modified to handle this more complex situation.

Using simple combinatorial arguments we show that for\nsmall sample sizes the modified Nyquist limit may overestimate the obtainable\nfrequency range.

A simple Fourier optics\nformalism applicable to both imaging arrays and nulling interferometers is\npresented, allowing to derive their basic theoretical relationships as\nconvolution or cross correlation products suitable for fast and accurate\ncomputation. Several unusual designs, such as a super-resolving telescope\nutilizing a mosaicking observation procedure or a free-flying, axially\nrecombined interferometer are examined, and their performance in terms of\nimaging and nulling capacity are assessed. In all considered cases, it is found\nthat the limiting parameter is the diameter of the individual telescopes. The\nentire study is only valid in the frame of first-order geometrical optics and\nscalar diffraction theory. Furthermore, it is assumed that all entrance\nsub-apertures are optically conjugated with their associated exit pupils, a\nparticularity inducing an instrumental behavior comparable with those of\ndiffraction gratings.",

        "title": "Astrometric Redshifts for Quasars",
        "summary": "The wavelength dependence of atmospheric refraction causes differential\nchromatic refraction (DCR), whereby objects imaged at different optical/UV\nwavelengths are observed at slightly different positions in the plane of the\ndetector. Strong spectral features induce changes in the effective wavelengths\nof broad-band filters that are capable of producing significant positional\noffsets with respect to standard DCR corrections. We examine such offsets for\nbroad-emission-line (type 1) quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nspanning 0<z<5 and an airmass range of 1.0 to 1.8. These offsets are in good\nagreement with those predicted by convolving a composite quasar spectrum with\nthe SDSS bandpasses as a function of redshift and airmass. This astrometric\ninformation can be used to break degeneracies in photometric redshifts of\nquasars (or other emission-line sources) and, for extreme cases, may be\nsuitable for determining \"astrometric redshifts\". On the SDSS's southern\nequatorial stripe, where it is possible to average many multi-epoch\nmeasurements, more than 60% of quasars have emission-line-induced astrometric\noffsets larger than the SDSS's relative astrometric errors of 25-35 mas.\nFolding these astrometric offsets into photometric redshift estimates yields an\nimprovement of 9% within Delta z+/-0.1. Future multi-epoch synoptic surveys\nsuch as LSST and Pan-STARRS could benefit from intentionally making ~10\nobservations at relatively high airmass (AM~1.4) in order to improve their\nphotometric redshifts for quasars.",

        "summary": "We report measurements of the fluctuations in atmospheric emission\n(atmospheric noise) above Mauna Kea recorded with Bolocam at 143 and 268 GHz\nfrom the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). The 143 GHz data were\ncollected during a 40 night observing run in late 2003, and the 268 GHz\nobservations were made in early 2004 and early 2005 over a total of 60 nights.\nBelow 0.5 Hz, the data time-streams are dominated by atmospheric noise in all\nobserving conditions. The atmospheric noise data are consistent with a\nKolmogorov-Taylor (K-T) turbulence model for a thin wind-driven screen, and the\nmedian amplitude of the fluctuations is 280 mK^2 rad^(-5/3) at 143 GHz and 4000\nmK^2 rad^(-5/3) at 268 GHz. Comparing our results with previous ACBAR data, we\nfind that the normalization of the power spectrum of the atmospheric noise\nfluctuations is a factor of 80 larger above Mauna Kea than above the South Pole\nat millimeter wavelengths. Most of this difference is due to the fact that the\natmosphere above the South Pole is much drier than the atmosphere above Mauna\nKea. However, the atmosphere above the South Pole is slightly more stable as\nwell: the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of precipitable water\nvapor are a factor of sqrt(2) smaller at the South Pole compared to Mauna Kea.\nBased on our atmospheric modeling, we developed several algorithms to remove\nthe atmospheric noise, and the best results were achieved when we described the\nfluctuations using a low-order polynomial in detector position over the 8\narcmin field of view (FOV). However, even with these algorithms, we were not\nable to reach photon-background-limited instrument photometer (BLIP)\nperformance at frequencies below 0.5 Hz in any observing conditions.",

        "title": "Ionospheric Calibration of Low Frequency Radio Interferometric\n  Observations using the Peeling Scheme: I. Method Description and First\n  Results",
        "summary": "Calibration of radio interferometric observations becomes increasingly\ndifficult towards lower frequencies. Below ~300 MHz, spatially variant\nrefractions and propagation delays of radio waves traveling through the\nionosphere cause phase rotations that can vary significantly with time, viewing\ndirection and antenna location. In this article we present a description and\nfirst results of SPAM (Source Peeling and Atmospheric Modeling), a new\ncalibration method that attempts to iteratively solve and correct for\nionospheric phase errors. To model the ionosphere, we construct a time-variant,\n2-dimensional phase screen at fixed height above the Earth's surface. Spatial\nvariations are described by a truncated set of discrete Karhunen-Loeve base\nfunctions, optimized for an assumed power-law spectral density of free\nelectrons density fluctuations, and a given configuration of calibrator sources\nand antenna locations. The model is constrained using antenna-based gain phases\nfrom individual self-calibrations on the available bright sources in the\nfield-of-view. Application of SPAM on three test cases, a simulated visibility\ndata set and two selected 74 MHz VLA data sets, yields significant improvements\nin image background noise (5-75 percent reduction) and source peak fluxes (up\nto 25 percent increase) as compared to the existing self-calibration and\nfield-based calibration methods, which indicates a significant improvement in\nionospheric phase calibration accuracy.",

        "title": "Neutrino Telescopes in the Mediterranean Sea",
        "summary": "The observation of high energy extraterrestrial neutrinos can be an\ninvaluable source of information about the most energetic phenomena in the\nUniverse. Neutrinos can shed light on the processes that accelerate charge\nparticles in an incredibly wide range of energies both within and outside our\nGalaxy. They can also help to investigate the nature of the dark matter that\npervades the Universe. The unique properties of the neutrino make it peerless\nas a cosmic messenger, enabling the study of dense and distant astrophysical\nobjects at high energy. The experimental challenge, however, is enormous. Due\nto the weakly interacting nature of neutrinos and the expected low fluxes very\nlarge detectors are required. In this paper we briefly review the neutrino\ntelescopes under the Mediterranean Sea that are operating or in progress. The\nfirst line of the ANTARES telescope started to take data in March 2006 and the\nfull 12-line detector was completed in May 2008. By January 2009 more than one\nthousand neutrino events had been reconstructed. Some of the results of ANTARES\nwill be reviewed. The NESTOR and NEMO projects have made a lot of progress to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of their proposed technological solutions. Finally,\nthe project of a km3-scale telescope, KM3NeT, is rapidly progressing: a\nconceptual design report was published in 2008 and a technical design report is\nexpected to be delivered by the end of 2009.",

        "summary": "The energy estimation procedures employed by different groups, for\ndetermining the energy of the primary $\\gamma$-ray using a single atmospheric\nCherenkov imaging telescope, include methods like polynomial fitting in SIZE\nand DISTANCE, general least square fitting and look-up table based\ninterpolation. A novel energy reconstruction procedure, based on the\nutilization of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), has been developed for the\nTACTIC atmospheric Cherenkov imaging telescope. The procedure uses a 3:30:1 ANN\nconfiguration with resilient backpropagation algorithm to estimate the energy\nof a $\\gamma$-ray like event on the basis of its image SIZE, DISTANCE and\nzenith angle. The new ANN-based energy reconstruction method, apart from\nyielding an energy resolution of $\\sim$ 26%, which is comparable to that of\nother single imaging telescopes, has the added advantage that it considers\nzenith angle dependence as well. Details of the ANN-based energy estimation\nprocedure along with its comparative performance with other conventional energy\nreconstruction methods are presented in the paper and the results indicate that\namongst all the methods considered in this work, ANN method yields the best\nresults. The performance of the ANN-based energy reconstruction has also been\nvalidated by determining the energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula in the energy\nrange 1-16 TeV, as measured by the TACTIC telescope.",

        "summary": "The recent discovery of a three-planet extrasolar system of HR 8799 by Marois\net al. is a breakthrough in the field of the direct imaging. This great\nachievement raises questions on the formation and dynamical stability of the HR\n8799 system, because Keplerian fits to astrometric data are strongly unstable\nduring ~0.2Myr. We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so\ncalled GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the\noptimization algorithm. Our searches reveal only small regions of stable\nmotions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations. Most\nlikely, if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range, they may be\nstable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion\nresonances (MMRs). We found that 80% systems found by GAMP that survived 30Myr\nbackwards integrations, eventually become unstable after 100Myr. It could mean\nthat the HR 8799 system undergo a phase of planet-planet scattering. We test a\nhypothesis that the less certain detection of the innermost object is due to a\nblending effect. In such a case, two-planet best-fit systems are mostly stable,\non quasi-circular orbits and close to the 5:2 MMR, resembling the\nJupiter-Saturn pair.",

        "summary": "(Abridged) We introduce a novel technique to construct spatially resolved\nmaps of stellar mass surface density in galaxies based on optical and near IR\nimaging. We use optical/NIR colour(s) to infer effective stellar mass-to-light\nratios (M/L) at each pixel, which are then multiplied by the surface brightness\nto obtain the local stellar surface mass density. We build look-up tables to\nexpress M/L as a function of colour(s) by marginalizing over a Monte Carlo\nlibrary of 50,000 stellar population synthesis (SPS) models by Charlot &\nBruzual (2007), which include a revised prescription for the TP-AGB stellar\nevolutionary phase, with a wide range of dust exinctions. In order to extract\nreliable flux and colour information at any position in the galaxy, we perform\na median adaptive smoothing of the images that preserves the highest possible\nspatial resolution. As the most practical and robust, and hence fiducial\nmethod, we express the M/L in the H band as a function of (g-i) and (i-H).\nStellar mass maps computed in this way have a typical accuracy of 30 per cent\nor less at any given pixel, determined from the scatter in the models. We\ncompare maps obtained with our fiducial method with those derived using other\ncombinations of bandpasses and the old BC03 TP-AGB prescription. Finally, we\ncompare total stellar mass estimates obtained by integrating resolved mass maps\nwith those obtained with unresolved photometry. In galaxies with evident dust\nlanes, unresolved estimates may miss up to 40 per cent of the total stellar\nmass because dusty regions are strongly under-represented in the luminous\nfluxes.",

        "summary": "We report on an attempt to accurately wavelength calibrate four nights of\ndata taken with the Keck HIRES spectrograph on QSO PHL957, for the purpose of\ndetermining whether the fine structure constant was different in the past.\nUsing new software and techniques, we measured the redshifts of various Ni II,\nFe II, Si II, etc. lines in a damped Ly-alpha system at z=2.309. Roughly half\nthe data was taken through the Keck iodine cell which contains thousands of\nwell calibrated iodine lines. Using these iodine exposures to calibrate the\nnormal Th-Ar Keck data pipeline output we found absolute wavelength offsets of\n500 m/s to 1000 m/s with drifts of more than 500 m/s over a single night, and\ndrifts of nearly 2000 m/s over several nights. These offsets correspond to an\nabsolute redshift of uncertainty of about Delta z=10^{-5} (Delta lambda= 0.02\nAng), with daily drifts of around Delta z=5x10^{-6} (Delta lambda =0.01 Ang),\nand multiday drifts of nearly Delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 Ang). The causes of the\nwavelength offsets are not known, but since claimed shifts in the fine\nstructure constant would result in velocity shifts of less than 100 m/s, this\nlevel of systematic uncertainty makes may make it difficult to use Keck HIRES\ndata to constrain the change in the fine structure constant. Using our\ncalibrated data, we applied both our own fitting software and standard fitting\nsoftware to measure (Delta alpha)/alpha, but discovered that we could obtain\nresults ranging from significant detection of either sign, to strong null\nlimits, depending upon which sets of lines and which fitting method was used.\nWe thus speculate that the discrepant results on (Delta alpha)/alpha reported\nin the literature may be due to random fluctuations coming from under-estimated\nsystematic errors in wavelength calibration and fitting procedure.",

        "summary": "Following the suggestion of Gould and Depoy (1998) we investigate the\nfeasibility of studying the brightest microlensing events towards the Galactic\nbulge using a small aperture (~10 cm) telescope. We used one of the HAT\ntelescopes to obtain 151 exposures spanning 88 nights in 2005 of an 8.4x8.4\nsquare degree FOV centered on (l,b) = (2.85, -5.00). We reduced the data using\nimage subtraction software. We find that such a search method can effectively\ncontribute to monitoring bright microlensing events, as was advocated.\nComparing this search method to the existing ones we find a dedicated bulge\nphotometric survey of this nature would fulfill a significant niche at\nexcellent performance and rather low cost. We obtain matches to 7 microlensing\nevents listed in the 2005 OGLE archives. We find several other light curves\nwhose fits closely resemble microlensing events. Unsurprisingly, many periodic\nvariables and miscellaneous variables are also detected in our data, and we\nestimate approximately 50% of these are new discoveries. We conclude by briefly\nproposing Small Aperture Microlensing Survey, which would monitor the Galactic\nbulge around the clock to provide dense coverage of the highest magnification\nmicrolensing events.",

        "title": "GASP - Galway Astronomical Stokes Polarimeter",
        "summary": "The Galway Astronomical Stokes Polarimeter (GASP) is an ultra-high-speed,\nfull Stokes, astronomical imaging polarimeter based upon a Division of\nAmplitude Polarimeter. It has been developed to resolve extremely rapid\nstochastic, millisecond variations in objects such as optical pulsars, RRATs\nand magnetic cataclysmic variables. GASP has no moving parts or modulated\ncomponents, so the complete Stokes vector can be measured from just one\nexposure - making it unique to astronomy. Furthermore the time required for the\ndetermination of the full Stokes vector is limited only by the time resolution\nof the detectors used and the incident photon fluxes. GASP utilizes a modified\nFresnel rhomb, which acts as a highly achromatic quarter wave plate and a\nbeamsplitter (referred to as an RBS). Here we present a description of how the\nDOAP works, some of the optical designs for the polarimeter, and give some\npreliminary results. Calibration is an important, and difficult issue with all\npolarimeters, but particularly in astronomical polarimeters. We give a\ndescription of calibration techniques appropriate to this type of polarimeter,\nparticularly the Eigenvalue Calibration Method of Compain & Drevillon",

Systematic effect of imbalance differential observation and\nsignificant t-N correlation in magnitude, distribution non-Gaussianity and\nnorth-south asymmetry are found.

        "summary": "We have detected asymmetry in the symbiotic star CH Cyg through the\nmeasurement of precision closure-phase with the IONIC beam combiner, at the\nIOTA interferometer. The position of the asymmetry changes with time and is\ncorrelated with the phase of the 2.1-yr period found in the radial velocity\nmeasurements for this star. We can model the time-dependent asymmetry either as\nthe orbit of a low-mass companion around the M giant or as an asymmetric, 20%\nchange in brightness across the M giant. We do not detect a change in the size\nof the star during a 3 year monitoring period neither with respect to time nor\nwith respect to wavelength. We find a spherical dust-shell with an emission\nsize of 2.2+/-0.1 D* FWHM around the M giant star. The star to dust flux ratio\nis estimated to be 11.63+/-0.3. While the most likely explanation for the 20%\nchange in brightness is non-radial pulsation we argue that a low-mass companion\nin close orbit could be the physical cause of the pulsation. The combined\neffect of pulsation and low-mass companion could explain the behaviour revealed\nby the radial-velocity curves and the time-dependent asymmetry detected in the\nclosure-phase data. If CH Cyg is a typical long secondary period variable then\nthese variations could be explained by the effect of an orbiting low-mass\ncompanion on the primary star.",

Visibilities and closure phases\nwere obtained using the IONIC-3 integrated optics beam combiner. CI Cam was\nobserved in the near-infrared H and K spectral bands, wavelengths well suited\nto measure the size and study the geometry of the hot dust surrounding CI Cam.\nThe analysis of the visibility data over an 8 year period from soon after the\n1998 outburst to 2006 shows that the dust visibility has not changed over the\nyears. The visibility data shows that CI Cam is elongated which confirms the\ndisc-shape of the circumstellar environment and totally rules out the\nhypothesis of a spherical dust shell. Closure phase measurements show direct\nevidence of asymmetries in the circumstellar environment of CI Cam and we\nconclude that the dust surrounding CI Cam lies in an inhomogeneous disc seen at\nan angle. The near-infrared dust emission appears as an elliptical skewed\nGaussian ring with a major axis a = 7.58 +/- 0.24 mas, an axis ratio r = 0.39\n+/- 0.03 and a position angle theta = 35 +/- 2 deg.",

        "title": "Using Spectral Flux Ratios to Standardize SN Ia Luminosities",
        "summary": "We present a new method to standardize Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities\nto ~<0.13 magnitudes using flux ratios from a single flux-calibrated spectrum\nper SN. Using Nearby Supernova Factory spectrophotomery of 58 SNe Ia, we\nperformed an unbiased search for flux ratios which correlate with SN Ia\nluminosity. After developing the method and selecting the best ratios from a\ntraining sample, we verified the results on a separate validation sample and\nwith data from the literature. We identified multiple flux ratios whose\ncorrelations with luminosity are stronger than those of light curve shape and\ncolor, previously identified spectral feature ratios, or equivalent width\nmeasurements. In particular, the flux ratio R(642/443) = F(642 nm) / F(443 nm)\nhas a correlation of 0.95 with SN Ia absolute magnitudes. Using this single\nratio as a correction factor produces a Hubble diagram with a residual scatter\nstandard deviation of 0.125 +- 0.011 mag, compared with 0.161 +- 0.015 mag when\nfit with the SALT2 light curve shape and color parameters x1 and c. The ratio\nR(642/443) is an effective correction factor for both extrinsic dust reddening\nand instrinsic variations such as those of SN 1991T-like and SN 1999aa-like\nSNe. When combined with broad-band color measurements, spectral flux ratios can\nstandardize SN Ia magnitudes to ~0.12 mag. These are the first spectral metrics\nthat improve over the standard normalization methods based upon light curve\nshape and color and they provide among the lowest scatter Hubble diagrams ever\npublished.",

In addition, correlations\nbetween the different images of the same shower are taken into account. An\nanalysis method based on a simple 3D-model of electromagnetic showers was\nrecently implemented in the framework of the H.E.S.S. experiment. In the\npresent article, the method is completed by an additional quality criterion,\nwhich reduces the background contamination by a factor of about 2 in the case\nof extended sources, while keeping gamma-ray efficiency at a high level. On the\nother hand, the dramatic flares of the blazar PKS 2155-304 in July 2006, which\nprovided H.E.S.S. data with an almost pure gamma-ray sample, offered the unique\nopportunity of a precision test of the 3D-reconstruction method as well as of\nthe H.E.S.S. simulations used in its calibration. An agreement at a few percent\nlevel is found between data and simulations for the distributions of all 3D\nshower parameters.",

        "summary": "We show that correlation functions have to satisfy contraint relations, owing\nto the non-negativity of the power spectrum of the underlying random process.\nSpecifically, for any statistically homogeneous and (for more than one spatial\ndimension) isotropic random field with correlation function $\\xi(x)$, we derive\ninequalities for the correlation coefficients $r_n\\equiv \\xi(n x)/\\xi(0)$ (for\ninteger $n$) of the form $r_{n{\\rm l}}\\le r_n\\le r_{n{\\rm u}}$, where the lower\nand upper bounds on $r_n$ depend on the $r_j$, with $j<n$. Explicit expressions\nfor the bounds are obtained for arbitrary $n$. These constraint equations very\nsignificantly limit the set of possible correlation functions. For one\nparticular example of a fiducial cosmic shear survey, we show that the Gaussian\nlikelihood ellipsoid has a significant spill-over into the forbidden region of\ncorrelation functions, rendering the resulting best-fitting model parameters\nand their error region questionable, and indicating the need for a better\ndescription of the likelihood function.\n  We conduct some simple numerical experiments which explicitly demonstrate the\nfailure of a Gaussian description for the likelihood of $\\xi$. Instead, the\nshape of the likelihood function of the correlation coefficients appears to\nfollow approximately that of the shape of the bounds on the $r_n$, even if the\nGaussian ellipsoid lies well within the allowed region.\n  For more than one spatial dimension of the random field, the explicit\nexpressions of the bounds on the $r_n$ are not optimal. We outline a\ngeometrical method how tighter bounds may be obtained in principle. We\nillustrate this method for a few simple cases; a more general treatment awaits\nfuture work.",

Measurements are\nperformed with the MASS (Multi-Aperture Scintillation Sensor) device which is\nwidely used in similar studies during last years at several observatories\nacross the world. The data analysis shows that median seeing in free atmosphere\n(at altitudes above 0.5km) is 0.46 arcsec and median isoplanatic angle is 2.47\narcsec. Given a rather long atmospheric coherence time (about 7 ms when the\nseeing is good) such conditions are favorable for adaptive optics and\ninterferometry in the visible and near-IR.",

Positions of bright (above 15-$\\sigma$) sources, common to MRT and MRC\ncatalogues, are used to set up an over-determined system to solve for the 2-D\nhomography matrix. After correction, the errors are found to be within 10% of\nthe beamwidth for these bright sources and the systematics are eliminated from\nthe images.",

        "title": "EUV Observational consequences of the spatial localisation of nanoflare\n  heating within a multi-stranded atmospheric loop",
        "summary": "Determining the preferred spatial location of the energy input to solar\ncoronal loops would be an important step forward towards a more complete\nunderstanding of the coronal heating problem. Following on from Sarkar & Walsh\n(2008) this paper presents a short 10e9 cm \"global loop\" as 125 individual\nstrands, where each strand is modelled independently by a one-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulation. The strands undergo small-scale episodic heating and\nare coupled together through the frequency distribution of the total energy\ninput to the loop which follows a power law distribution with index ~ 2.29. The\nspatial preference of the swarm of heating events from apex to footpoint is\ninvestigated. From a theoretical perspective, the resulting emission measure\nweighted temperature profiles along these two extreme cases does demonstrate a\npossible observable difference. Subsequently, the simulated output is folded\nthrough the TRACE instrument response functions and a re-derivation of the\ntemperature using different filter-ratio techniques is performed. Given the\nmulti-thermal scenario created by this many strand loop model, a broad\ndifferential emission measure results; the subsequent double and triple filter\nratios are very similar to those obtained from observations. However, any\npotential observational signature to differentiate between apex and footpoint\ndominant heating is possibly below instrumental thresholds. The consequences of\nusing a broadband instrument like TRACE and Hinode-XRT in this way are\ndiscussed.",

By replacing a few lines of\ncode to include Newton's gravity, virtual world software can become an N-body\nsimulation code with visualization included where objects move under their\nmutual gravitational attraction as stars in a cluster. We report on our recent\nexperience of adding a gravitational N-body simulator to the OpenSim virtual\nworld physics engine. OpenSim is an open-source, virtual world server that\nprovides a 3D immersive experience to users who connect using the popular\n\"Second Life\" client software from Linden Labs. With the addition of the N-body\nsimulation engine, which we are calling NEO, short for N-Body Experiments in\nOpenSim, multiple users can collaboratively create point-mass gravitating\nobjects in the virtual world and then observe the subsequent gravitational\nevolution of their \"stellar\" system. We view this work as an experiment\nexamining the suitability of virtual worlds for scientific visualization, and\nwe report on future work to enhance and expand the prototype we have built. We\nalso discuss some standardization and technology issues raised by our unusual\nuse of virtual worlds.",

        "summary": "We study two limiting cases of turbulence forcing in numerical experiments:\nsolenoidal (divergence-free) forcing, and compressive (curl-free) forcing, and\ncompare our results to observations reported in the literature. We solve the\nequations of hydrodynamics on grids with up to 1024^3 cells for purely\nsolenoidal and purely compressive forcing. Eleven lower-resolution models with\nmixtures of both forcings are also analysed. We find velocity dispersion--size\nrelations consistent with observations and independent numerical simulations,\nirrespective of the type of forcing. However, compressive forcing yields\nstronger turbulent compression at the same RMS Mach number than solenoidal\nforcing, resulting in a three times larger standard deviation of volumetric and\ncolumn density probability distributions (PDFs). We conclude that the strong\ndependence of the density PDF on the type of forcing must be taken into account\nin any theory using the PDF to predict properties of star formation. We supply\na quantitative description of this dependence. We find that different observed\nregions show evidence of different mixtures of compressive and solenoidal\nforcing, with more compressive forcing occurring primarily in swept-up shells.",

        "summary": "We have confirmed the existence of the transiting super Neptune extrasolar\nplanet HAT-P-11b. On May 1, 2009 UT the transit of HAT-P-11b was detected at\nthe University of Arizona's 1.55m Kuiper Telescope with 1.7 millimag rms\naccuracy. We find a central transit time of T_c = 2454952.92534+/-0.00060 BJD;\nthis transit occurred 80+/-73 seconds sooner than previous measurements (71\norbits in the past) would have predicted. Hence, our transit timing rules out\nthe presence of any large (>200 s) deviations from the ephemeris of Bakos et\nal. (2009). We obtain a slightly more accurate period of\nP=4.8878045+/-0.0000043 days. We measure a slightly larger planetary radius of\nR_p=0.452+/-0.020 R_J (5.07+/-0.22 R_earth) compared to Bakos and co-workers'\nvalue of 0.422+/-0.014 R_J (4.73+/-0.16 R_earth).

        "summary": "The Fresnel Interferometric Imager is a space-based astronomical telescope\nproject yielding milli-arc second angular resolution and high contrast images\nwith loose manufacturing constraints. This optical concept involves diffractive\nfocusing and formation flying: a first \"primary optics\" space module holds a\nlarge binary Fresnel Array, and a second \"focal module\" holds optical elements\nand focal instruments that allow for chromatic dispersion correction.\n  We have designed a reduced-size Fresnel Interferometric Imager prototype and\nmade optical tests in our lab, in order to validate the concept for future\nspace missions. The Primary module of this prototype consists of a square, 8 cm\nside, 23 m focal length Fresnel array. The focal module is composed of a\ndiaphragmed small telescope used as \"field lens\", a small cophased diverging\nFresnel Zone Lens (FZL) that cancels the dispersion and a detector. An\nadditional module collimates the artificial targets of various shapes, sizes\nand dynamic ranges to be imaged.\n  In this paper, we describe the experimental setup, different designs of the\nprimary Fresnel array, and the cophased Fresnel Zone Lens that achieves\nrigorous chromatic correction. We give quantitative measurements of the\ndiffraction limited performances and dynamic range on double sources. The tests\nhave been performed in the visible domain, lambda = 400 - 700 nm.\n  In addition, we present computer simulations of the prototype optics based on\nFresnel propagation, that corroborate the optical tests. This numerical tool\nhas been used to simulate the large aperture Fresnel arrays that could be sent\nto space with diameters of 3 to 30 m, foreseen to operate from Lyman-alpha (121\nnm) to mid I.R. (25 microns).",

In the first\nphase of this project, receiver systems consisting of V-dipole feeds and\nfront-ends have been installed on four of the thirty GMRT antennas. Test\nobservations were carried out on a number of bright 3C sources. The initial\nresults are encouraging.

        "summary": "We investigate the influence of the external tidal field of a dark matter\nhalo on the dynamical evolution of star clusters using direct N-body\nsimulations, where we assume that the halo is described by a Navarro, Frenk &\nWhite mass profile which has an inner density cusp. We assess how varying the\nmass and concentration of the halo affects the rate at which the star cluster\nloses mass and we find that increasing halo mass and concentration drives\nenhanced mass loss rates and in principle shorter cluster disruption\ntimescales. In addition, we examine disruption timescales in a three-component\nmodel of a galaxy (bulge, disk and dark matter halo) and find good agreement\nwith results based on an empirical model of the Galactic potential if we assume\na halo mass of ~1e12 solar masses. In general, dark matter halos are expected\nto contribute significantly to the masses of galaxies and should not be ignored\nwhen modelling the evolution of star clusters. We extend our results to discuss\nhow this can have a potentially profound effect on the disruption timescales of\nglobular clusters, suggesting that we may underestimate the rate at which\nprimordial globular clusters are disrupted.",

        "summary": "Currently the only technique sensitive to Earth mass planets around nearby\nstars (that are too close for microlensing) is the monitoring of the transit\ntime variations of the transiting extrasolar planets. We search for additional\nplanets in the systems of the hot Neptune GJ 436b, and the hot-Jupiter XO-1b,\nusing high cadence observations in the J and Ks bands. New high-precision\ntransit timing measurements are reported: GJ 436b Tc = 2454238.47898 \\pm\n0.00046 HJD; XO-1b Tc(A) = 2454218.83331 \\pm 0.00114 HJD, Tc(B) = 2454222.77539\n\\pm 0.00036 HJD, Tc(C) = 2454222.77597 \\pm 0.00039 HJD, Tc(D) = 2454226.71769\n\\pm 0.00034 HJD, and they were used to derive new ephemeris. We also determined\ndepths for these transits. No statistically significant timing deviations were\ndetected. We demonstrate that the high cadence ground based near-infrared\nobservations are successful in constraining the mean transit time to ~30 sec.,\nand are a viable alternative to space missions.",

The first project, in the 1960s, was the Narrabri Stellar\nIntensity Interferometer, which measured the angular diameters of 32 hot stars\nand established the temperature scale for spectral classes O - F. That\ninstrument was followed by the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer (SUSI),\nwhich is now undergoing a third-generation upgrade, to use the multi-wavelength\nPAVO beam combiner. SUSI operates at visible rather than IR wavelengths and has\nbaselines up to 160 m, so it is well suited to the study of hot stars. A number\nof studies have been carried out, and more are planned when commissioning of\nthe PAVO system is complete. Conversion of the system to allow remote operation\nwill allow larger scientific projects to be undertaken.",

This calibration source\nwill allow the characterization of the scintillation and ionization response of\nnoble liquid detectors at low energies, highly valuable for the search for WIMP\ndark matter.

        "summary": "Two-dimensional kinematics of the central region of M 83 (NGC 5236) were\nobtained through three-dimensional NIR spectroscopy with Gemini South\ntelescope. The spatial region covered by the integral field unit (~5\" x 13\" or\n~90 x 240 pc), was centered approximately at the center of the bulge isophotes\nand oriented SE-NW. The Pa_beta emission at half arcsecond resolution clearly\nreveals spider-like diagrams around three centers, indicating the presence of\nextended masses, which we describe in terms of Satoh distributions. One of the\nmass concentrations is identified as the optical nucleus (ON), another as the\ncenter of the bulge isophotes, similar to the CO kinematical center (KC), and\nthe third as a condensation hidden at optical wavelengths (HN), coincident with\nthe largest lobe in 10 micron emission. We run numerical simulations that take\ninto account ON, KC and HN and four more clusters, representing the star\nforming arc at the SW of the optical nucleus. We show that ON, KC and HN suffer\nstrong evaporation and merge in 10-50 Myr. The star-forming arc is scattered in\nless than one orbital period, also falling into the center. Simulations also\nshow that tidal-striping boosts the external shell of the condensations to\ntheir escape velocity. This fact might lead to an overestimation of the mass of\nthe condensations in kinematical observations with spatial resolution smaller\nthan the condensations' apparent sizes. Additionally the existence of two ILR\nresonances embracing the chain of HII regions, claimed by different authors,\nmight not exist due to the similarity of the masses of the different components\nand the fast dynamical evolution of M83 central 300 pc.",

        "summary": "In order to attract and retain excellent researchers and diverse individuals\nin astrophysics, we recommend action be taken in several key areas impacting\nyoung scientists: (1) Maintain balance between large collaborations and\nindividual projects through distribution of funding; encourage public releases\nof observational and simulation data for use by a broader community. (2)\nImprove the involvement of women, particularly at leading institutions. (3)\nAddress the critical shortage of child care options and design reasonable\nprofession-wide parental leave policies. (4) Streamline the job application and\nhiring process. We summarize our reasons for bringing these areas to the\nattention of the committee, and we suggest several practical steps that can be\ntaken to address them.",

        "title": "The Synoptic All-Sky Infrared (SASIR) Survey",
        "summary": "We are proposing to conduct a multicolor, synoptic infrared (IR) imaging\nsurvey of the Northern sky with a new, dedicated 6.5-meter telescope at San\nPedro M\\'artir (SPM) Observatory. This initiative is being developed in\npartnership with astronomy institutions in Mexico and the University of\nCalifornia. The 4-year, dedicated survey, planned to begin in 2017, will reach\nmore than 100 times deeper than 2MASS. The Synoptic All-Sky Infrared (SASIR)\nSurvey will reveal the missing sample of faint red dwarf stars in the local\nsolar neighborhood, and the unprecedented sensitivity over such a wide field\nwill result in the discovery of thousands of z ~ 7 quasars (and reaching to z >\n10), allowing detailed study (in concert with JWST and Giant Segmented Mirror\nTelescopes) of the timing and the origin(s) of reionization. As a time-domain\nsurvey, SASIR will reveal the dynamic infrared universe, opening new phase\nspace for discovery. Synoptic observations of over 10^6 supernovae and variable\nstars will provide better distance measures than optical studies alone. SASIR\nalso provides significant synergy with other major Astro2010 facilities,\nimproving the overall scientific return of community investments. Compared to\noptical-only measurements, IR colors vastly improve photometric redshifts to z\n~ 4, enhancing dark energy and dark matter surveys based on weak lensing and\nbaryon oscillations. The wide field and ToO capabilities will enable a\nconnection of the gravitational wave and neutrino universe - with events\notherwise poorly localized on the sky - to transient electromagnetic phenomena.",

In a second model we assume a linearly increasing radial velocity component\nwith an added poloidal component of order 10 km/s at latitudes around\n$70^\\circ$. The true velocity field is likely to be in between these two\nlimiting cases. We also find that the expansion of the ansae is non-radial with\nreference to the central star. Their velocity field is focused near the\napparent exit points from the main shell. We predict the proper motion pattern\nfor the model with a non-zero poloidal velocity component.",

In\nthis paper we present a dynamical measurement supporting this important result.\nWe measured the radial-velocity semi-amplitude of the white dwarf from the\nmotion of the wings of the Halpha emission line and obtained a figure of\nK1=34+/-4 km/s, in excellent agreement with the value of K1=35+/-2 km/s\npredicted by Littlefair et al.'s model.",

        "summary": "AMIGA (Auger Muons and Infill for the Ground Array) constitutes an\nenhancement for the Pierre Auger Observatory. It consists of a denser array of\nsurface detectors and muon counters whose objective is both to extend the\ndetection range down to 10^17 eV and to help towards mass composition\ndetermination. The latter is to be achieved with muon counters since the shower\nmuon content is one of the best parameter for particle type identification. In\nthis work, we present the study of a muon counter prototype. The prototype was\nburied 3 m deep in an effort to avoid signal contamination from the shower\nelectromagnetic component. We study the performance of the detector before and\nafter burying it with its associated electronic components. The detector\nvalidation is performed from signal analysis of charged particles traversing\nthe counter.",

In real applications, the order of the taxa best satisfying the above\nconditions can be obtained using the Minimum Contradiction method. This\napproach is applied to 2 sets of continuous characters.

        "summary": "The state of a non-relativistic gravitational dynamical system is known at\nany time $t$ if the dynamical rule, i.e. Newton's equations of motion, can be\nsolved; this requires specification of the gravitational potential. The\nevolution of a bunch of phase space coordinates ${\\bf w}$ is deterministic,\nthough generally non-linear. We discuss the novel Bayesian non-parametric\nalgorithm CHASSIS that gives phase space $pdf$ $f({\\bf w})$ and potential\n$\\Phi({\\bf x})$ of a relaxed gravitational system. CHASSIS is undemanding in\nterms of input requirements in that it is viable given incomplete,\nsingle-component velocity information of system members. Here ${\\bf x}$ is the\n3-D spatial coordinate and ${\\bf w}={\\bf x+v}$ where ${\\bf v}$ is the 3-D\nvelocity vector. CHASSIS works with a 2-integral $f=f(E, L)$ where energy\n$E=\\Phi + v^2/2, \\: v^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}{v_i^2}$ and the angular momentum is $L\n= |{\\bf r}\\times{\\bf v}|$, where ${\\bf r}$ is the spherical spatial vector.\nAlso, we assume spherical symmetry. CHASSIS obtains the $f(\\cdot)$ from which\nthe kinematic data is most likely to have been drawn, in the best choice for\n$\\Phi(\\cdot)$, using an MCMC optimiser (Metropolis-Hastings). The likelihood\nfunction ${\\cal{L}}$ is defined in terms of the projections of $f(\\cdot)$ into\nthe space of observables and the maximum in ${\\cal{L}}$ is sought by the\noptimiser.",

        "summary": "We propose a sociohistorical framework for better understanding the evolution\nin the use of telescopes. We define two regimes of use : a general-purpose (or\nsurvey) one, where the telescope governs research, and a dedicated one, in\nwhich the telescope is tailored to a specific project which includes a network\nof other tools. This conceptual framework is first applied to the history of\nthe 80-cm telescope of Toulouse Observatory, which is initially anchored in a\ngeneral-purpose regime linked to astrometry. After a transition in the 1930s,\nit is integrated in a dedicated regime centered on astrophysics. This evolution\nis compared to that of a very similar instrument, the 80-cm telescope of\nMarseille Observatory, which converts early on to the dedicated regime with the\nFabry-Perot interferometer around 1910, and, after a period of idleness, is\nagain used in the survey mode after WWII. To further validate our new concept,\nwe apply it to the telescopes of Washburn Observatory, of Dominion\nAstrophysical Observatory and of Meudon Observatory. The uses of the different\ntelescopes illustrate various combinations of the two regimes, which can be\nsuccessive, simultaneous or alternating. This conceptual framework is likely to\nbe applicable to other fields of pure and applied science.",

        "summary": "We present a new framework for radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Gas\ndynamics is modelled by the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method,\nwhereas radiation transfer is simulated via a time-dependent Monte-Carlo\napproach that traces photon packets. As a first step in the development of the\nmethod, in this paper we consider the momentum transfer between radiation field\nand gas, which is important for systems where radiation pressure is high. There\nis no fundamental limitations on the number of radiation sources, geometry or\nthe optical depth of the problems that can be studied with the method. However,\nas expected for any Monte-Carlo transfer scheme, stochastic noise presents a\nserious limitation. We present a number of tests that show that the errors of\nthe method can be estimated accurately by considering Poisson noise\nfluctuations in the number of photon packets that SPH particles interact with\nper dynamical time. It is found that for a reasonable accuracy the momentum\ncarried by photon packets must be much smaller than a typical momentum of SPH\nparticles. We discuss numerical limitations of the code, and future steps that\ncan be taken to improve performance and applicability of the method.",

        "summary": "The detrending algorithms which are widely used to reduce the impact of\nstellar variability on space-based transit surveys are ill-suited for\nestimating the parameters of confirmed planets, as they unavoidably alter the\ntransit signal. We present a post-detection detrending algorithm, which filters\nout signal on other timescales than the period of the transit while preserving\nthe transit signal.\n  We compare the performance of this new filter to a well-established\npre-detection detrending algorithm, by applying both to a set of 20 simulated\nlight curves containing planetary transits, stellar variability, and\ninstrumental noise as expected for the CoRoT space mission, and performing\nanalytic fits to the transits. Compared to the pre-detection benchmark, the new\npost-detection filter systematically yields significantly reduced errors\n(median reduction in relative error over our sample of about 40%) on the\nplanet-to-star radius ratio, system scale and impact parameter. This is\nparticularly important for active stars, where errors induced by variability\ncan otherwise dominate the final error budget on the planet parameters.\n  Aside from improving planet parameter estimates, the new filter preserves all\nsignal at the orbital period of the planet, and thus could also be used to\nsearch for light reflected by the planet.",

The synoptic\npipeline provides additional quality control and calibration to these data in\nthe process of generating accurate light-curves.

Attempts to understand and overcome these systematic\nproblems will be presented. Forward models based on ray theory have been\napplied in order to test the sensitivity of travel times to various models.",

An algorithm is presented that can be used for the automated\ndetection of the MBPs in the spatial and temporal domains. The algorithm works\nby mapping the lanes through intensity thresholding. A compass search, combined\nwith a study of the intensity gradient across the detected objects, allows the\ndisentanglement of MBPs from bright pixels within the granules. Object growing\nis implemented to account for any pixels that might have been removed when\nmapping the lanes. The images are stabilized by locating long-lived objects\nthat may have been missed due to variable light levels and seeing quality.\nTests of the algorithm employing data taken with the Swedish Solar Telescope\n(SST), reveal that ~90% of MBPs within a 75\"x 75\" field of view are detected.",

We propose and evaluate an\nalternative iterative scheme to the classical ALI-Jacobi method, and to the\nmore recently proposed Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over-Relaxation (GS/SOR)\nschemes. Our study is indeed based on the application of a preconditioned\nbi-conjugate gradient method (BiCG-P). Standard tests, in 1D plane parallel\ngeometry and in the frame of the two-level atom model, with monochromatic\nscattering, are discussed. Rates of convergence between the previously\nmentioned iterative schemes are compared, as well as their respective timing\nproperties. The smoothing capability of the BiCG-P method is also demonstrated.",

        "title": "Finding Anomalous Periodic Time Series: An Application to Catalogs of\n  Periodic Variable Stars",
        "summary": "Catalogs of periodic variable stars contain large numbers of periodic\nlight-curves (photometric time series data from the astrophysics domain).\nSeparating anomalous objects from well-known classes is an important step\ntowards the discovery of new classes of astronomical objects. Most anomaly\ndetection methods for time series data assume either a single continuous time\nseries or a set of time series whose periods are aligned. Light-curve data\nprecludes the use of these methods as the periods of any given pair of\nlight-curves may be out of sync. One may use an existing anomaly detection\nmethod if, prior to similarity calculation, one performs the costly act of\naligning two light-curves, an operation that scales poorly to massive data\nsets. This paper presents PCAD, an unsupervised anomaly detection method for\nlarge sets of unsynchronized periodic time-series data, that outputs a ranked\nlist of both global and local anomalies. It calculates its anomaly score for\neach light-curve in relation to a set of centroids produced by a modified\nk-means clustering algorithm. Our method is able to scale to large data sets\nthrough the use of sampling. We validate our method on both light-curve data\nand other time series data sets. We demonstrate its effectiveness at finding\nknown anomalies, and discuss the effect of sample size and number of centroids\non our results. We compare our method to naive solutions and existing time\nseries anomaly detection methods for unphased data, and show that PCAD's\nreported anomalies are comparable to or better than all other methods. Finally,\nastrophysicists on our team have verified that PCAD finds true anomalies that\nmight be indicative of novel astrophysical phenomena.",

        "summary": "The mid-infrared properties of pre-planetary disks are sensitive to the\ntemperature and flaring profiles of disks for the regions where planet\nformation is expected to occur. In order to constrain theories of planet\nformation, we have carried out a mid-infrared (wavelength 10.7 microns) size\nsurvey of young stellar objects using the segmented Keck telescope in a novel\nconfiguration. We introduced a customized pattern of tilts to individual mirror\nsegments to allow efficient sparse-aperture interferometry, allowing full\naperture synthesis imaging with higher calibration precision than traditional\nimaging. In contrast to previous surveys on smaller telescopes and with poorer\ncalibration precision, we find most objects in our sample are partially\nresolved. Here we present the main observational results of our survey of 5\nembedded massive protostars, 25 Herbig Ae/Be stars, 3 T Tauri stars, 1 FU Ori\nsystem, and 5 emission-line objects of uncertain classification. The observed\nmid-infrared sizes do not obey the size-luminosity relation found at\nnear-infrared wavelengths and a companion paper will provide further modelling\nanalysis of this sample. In addition, we report imaging results for a few of\nthe most resolved objects, including complex emission around embedded massive\nprotostars, the photoevaporating circumbinary disk around MWC 361A, and the\nsubarcsecond binaries T Tau, FU Ori and MWC 1080.",

        "title": "Optimizing baryon acoustic oscillation surveys II: curvature, redshifts,\n  and external datasets",
        "summary": "We extend our study of the optimization of large baryon acoustic oscillation\n(BAO) surveys to return the best constraints on the dark energy, building on\nPaper I of this series (Parkinson et al. 2007). The survey galaxies are assumed\nto be pre-selected active, star-forming galaxies observed by their line\nemission with a constant number density across the redshift bin. Star-forming\ngalaxies have a redshift desert in the region 1.6 < z < 2, and so this redshift\nrange was excluded from the analysis. We use the Seo & Eisenstein (2007)\nfitting formula for the accuracies of the BAO measurements, using only the\ninformation for the oscillatory part of the power spectrum as distance and\nexpansion rate rulers. We go beyond our earlier analysis by examining the\neffect of including curvature on the optimal survey configuration and updating\nthe expected `prior' constraints from Planck and SDSS. We once again find that\nthe optimal survey strategy involves minimizing the exposure time and\nmaximizing the survey area (within the instrumental constraints), and that all\ntime should be spent observing in the low-redshift range (z<1.6) rather than\nbeyond the redshift desert, z>2. We find that when assuming a flat universe the\noptimal survey makes measurements in the redshift range 0.1 < z <0.7, but that\nincluding curvature as a nuisance parameter requires us to push the maximum\nredshift to 1.35, to remove the degeneracy between curvature and evolving dark\nenergy. The inclusion of expected other data sets (such as WiggleZ, BOSS and a\nstage III SN-Ia survey) removes the necessity of measurements below redshift\n0.9, and pushes the maximum redshift up to 1.5. We discuss considerations in\ndetermining the best survey strategy in light of uncertainty in the true\nunderlying cosmological model.",

        "summary": "The Sixth Data Release (DR6) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) provides\nmore photometric regions, new features and more accurate data around globular\ncluster Palomar 5. A new method, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), is\nused to estimate the probability of cluster member to detect its tidal tails.\nCluster and field stars, used for training the networks, are extracted over a\n$40\\times20$ deg$^2$ field by color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The best BPNNs\nwith two hidden layers and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training algorithm are\ndetermined by the chosen cluster and field samples. The membership\nprobabilities of stars in the whole field are obtained with the BPNNs, and\ncontour maps of the probability distribution show that a tail extends $5.42\\dg$\nto the north of the cluster and a tail extends $3.77\\dg$ to the south. The\nwhole tails are similar to those detected by \\citet{od03}, but no longer debris\nof the cluster is found to the northeast of the sky. The radial density\nprofiles are investigated both along the tails and near the cluster center.\nQuite a few substructures are discovered in the tails. The number density\nprofile of the cluster is fitted with the King model and the tidal radius is\ndetermined as $14.28'$. However, the King model cannot fit the observed profile\nat the outer regions ($R > 8'$) because of the tidal tails generated by the\ntidal force. Luminosity functions of the cluster and the tidal tails are\ncalculated, which confirm that the tails originate from Palomar 5.",

        "summary": "Context. Mathematical optimization can be used as a computational tool to\nobtain the optimal solution to a given problem in a systematic and efficient\nway. For example, in twice-differentiable functions and problems with no\nconstraints, the optimization consists of finding the points where the gradient\nof the objective function is zero and using the Hessian matrix to classify the\ntype of each point. Sometimes, however it is impossible to compute these\nderivatives and other type of techniques must be employed such as the steepest\ndescent/ascent method and more sophisticated methods such as those based on the\nevolutionary algorithms. Aims. We present a simple algorithm based on the idea\nof genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization. We refer to this algorithm as AGA\n(Asexual Genetic Algorithm) and apply it to two kinds of problems: the\nmaximization of a function where classical methods fail and model fitting in\nastronomy. For the latter case, we minimize the chi-square function to estimate\nthe parameters in two examples: the orbits of exoplanets by taking a set of\nradial velocity data, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed\ntowards a YSO (Young Stellar Object). Methods. The algorithm AGA may also be\ncalled genetic, although it differs from standard genetic algorithms in two\nmain aspects: a) the initial population is not encoded, and b) the new\ngenerations are constructed by asexual reproduction. Results. Applying our\nalgorithm in optimizing some complicated functions, we find the global maxima\nwithin a few iterations. For model fitting to the orbits of exoplanets and the\nSED of a YSO, we estimate the parameters and their associated errors.",

        "title": "New Approaches To Photometric Redshift Prediction Via Gaussian Process\n  Regression In The Sloan Digital Sky Survey",
        "summary": "Expanding upon the work of Way and Srivastava 2006 we demonstrate how the use\nof training sets of comparable size continue to make Gaussian process\nregression (GPR) a competitive approach to that of neural networks and other\nleast-squares fitting methods. This is possible via new large size matrix\ninversion techniques developed for Gaussian processes (GPs) that do not require\nthat the kernel matrix be sparse. This development, combined with a\nneural-network kernel function appears to give superior results for this\nproblem. Our best fit results for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main\nGalaxy Sample using u,g,r,i,z filters gives an rms error of 0.0201 while our\nresults for the same filters in the luminous red galaxy sample yield 0.0220. We\nalso demonstrate that there appears to be a minimum number of training-set\ngalaxies needed to obtain the optimal fit when using our GPR rank-reduction\nmethods. We find that morphological information included with many photometric\nsurveys appears, for the most part, to make the photometric redshift evaluation\nslightly worse rather than better. This would indicate that most morphological\ninformation simply adds noise from the GP point of view in the data used\nherein. In addition, we show that cross-match catalog results involving\ncombinations of the Two Micron All Sky Survey, SDSS, and Galaxy Evolution\nExplorer have to be evaluated in the context of the resulting cross-match\nmagnitude and redshift distribution. Otherwise one may be misled into overly\noptimistic conclusions.",

        "summary": "The Antarctic plateau contains the best sites on earth for many forms of\nastronomy, but none of the existing bases was selected with astronomy as the\nprimary motivation. In this article, we try to systematically compare the\nmerits of potential observatory sites.We include South Pole, Domes A, C, and F,\nand also Ridge B (running northeast from Dome A), and what we call \"Ridge A\"\n(running southwest from Dome A). Our analysis combines satellite data,\npublished results, and atmospheric models, to compare the boundary layer,\nweather, aurorae, airglow, precipitable water vapor, thermal sky emission,\nsurface temperature, and the free atmosphere, at each site. We find that all\nAntarctic sites are likely to be compromised for optical work by airglow and\naurorae. Of the sites with existing bases, Dome A is easily the best overall;\nbut we find that Ridge A offers an even better site. We also find that Dome F\nis a remarkably good site. Dome C is less good as a thermal infrared or\nterahertz site, but would be able to take advantage of a predicted \"OH hole\"\nover Antarctica during spring.",

We identify a variety of sources, such as intrinsic\ncontaminations due to primordial radioisotopes and cosmogenic activation of the\ntarget material. In particular, we detect a 3.6keV X-ray line from the decay of\n41-Ca with an activity of (26\\pm4)\\mu Bq, corresponding to a ratio\n41-Ca/40-Ca=(2.2\\pm0.3)\\times10^{-16}.",

        "summary": "PILOT (the Pathfinder for an International Large Optical Telescope) is a\nproposed 2.5 m optical/infrared telescope to be located at Dome C on the\nAntarctic plateau. Conditions at Dome C are known to be exceptional for\nastronomy. The seeing (above ~30 m height), coherence time, and isoplanatic\nangle are all twice s good as at typical mid-latitude sites, while the\nwater-vapour column, and the atmosphere and telescope thermal emission are all\nan order of magnitude better. These conditions enable a unique scientific\ncapability for PILOT, which is addressed in this series of papers. The current\npaper presents an overview of the optical and instrumentation suite for PILO\nand its expected performance, a summary of the key science goals and\nobservational approach for the facility, a discussion of the synergies between\nthe science goals for PILOT and other telescopes, and a discussion of the\nfuture of Antarctic astronomy. Paper II and Paper III present details of the\nscience projects divided, respectively, between the distant Universe (i.e.,\nstudies of first light, and the assembly and evolution of structure) and the\nnearby Universe (i.e., studies of Local Group galaxies, the Milky Way, and the\nSolar System).",

        "summary": "The two-point angular correlation function is a traditional method used to\nsearch for deviations from expectations of isotropy. In this paper we develop\nand explore a statistically descriptive three-point method with the intended\napplication being the search for deviations from isotropy in the highest energy\ncosmic rays. We compare the sensitivity of a two-point method and a\n\"shape-strength\" method for a variety of Monte-Carlo simulated anisotropic\nsignals. Studies are done with anisotropic source signals diluted by an\nisotropic background. Type I and II errors for rejecting the hypothesis of\nisotropic cosmic ray arrival directions are evaluated for four different event\nsample sizes: 27, 40, 60 and 80 events, consistent with near term data\nexpectations from the Pierre Auger Observatory. In all cases the ability to\nreject the isotropic hypothesis improves with event size and with the fraction\nof anisotropic signal. While ~40 event data sets should be sufficient for\nreliable identification of anisotropy in cases of rather extreme (highly\nanisotropic) data, much larger data sets are suggested for reliable\nidentification of more subtle anisotropies. The shape-strength method\nconsistently performs better than the two point method and can be easily\nadapted to an arbitrary experimental exposure on the celestial sphere.",

        "title": "Probing Fine-Scale Ionospheric Structure with the Very Large Array Radio\n  Telescope",
        "summary": "High resolution (~1 arcminute) astronomical imaging at low frequency (below\n150 MHz) has only recently become practical with the development of new\ncalibration algorithms for removing ionospheric distortions. In addition to\nopening a new window in observational astronomy, the process of calibrating the\nionospheric distortions also probes ionospheric structure in an unprecedented\nway. Here we explore one aspect of this new type of ionospheric measurement,\nthe differential refraction of celestial source pairs as a function of their\nangular separation. This measurement probes variations in the spatial gradient\nof the line-of-sight total electron content (TEC) to 0.001 TECU/km accuracy\nover spatial scales of under 10 km to over 100 km. We use data from the VLA\nLow-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS; Cohen et al. 2007, AJ 134, 1245), a nearly\ncomplete 74 MHz survey of the entire sky visible to the Very Large Array (VLA)\ntelescope in Socorro, New Mexico. These data comprise over 500 hours of\nobservations, all calibrated in a standard way. While ionospheric spatial\nstructure varies greatly from one observation to the next, when analyzed over\nhundreds of hours, statistical patterns become apparent. We present a detailed\ncharacterization of how the median differential refraction depends on source\npair separation, elevation and time of day. We find that elevation effects are\nlarge, but geometrically predictable and can be \"removed\" analytically using a\n\"thin-shell\" model of the ionosphere. We find significantly greater ionospheric\nspatial variations during the day than at night. These diurnal variations\nappear to affect the larger angular scales to a greater degree indicating that\nthey come from disturbances on relatively larger spatial scales (100s of km,\nrather than 10s of km).",

        "title": "Accurate parameter estimation for star formation history in galaxies\n  using SDSS spectra",
        "summary": "To further our knowledge of the complex physical process of galaxy formation,\nit is essential that we characterize the formation and evolution of large\ndatabases of galaxies. The spectral synthesis STARLIGHT code of Cid Fernandes\net al. (2004) was designed for this purpose. Results of STARLIGHT are highly\ndependent on the choice of input basis of simple stellar population (SSP)\nspectra. Speed of the code, which uses random walks through the parameter\nspace, scales as the square of the number of basis spectra, making it\ncomputationally necessary to choose a small number of SSPs that are coarsely\nsampled in age and metallicity. In this paper, we develop methods based on\ndiffusion map (Lafon & Lee, 2006) that, for the first time, choose appropriate\nbases of prototype SSP spectra from a large set of SSP spectra designed to\napproximate the continuous grid of age and metallicity of SSPs of which\ngalaxies are truly composed. We show that our techniques achieve better\naccuracy of physical parameter estimation for simulated galaxies. Specifically,\nwe show that our methods significantly decrease the age-metallicity degeneracy\nthat is common in galaxy population synthesis methods. We analyze a sample of\n3046 galaxies in SDSS DR6 and compare the parameter estimates obtained from\ndifferent basis choices.",

        "summary": "Aims: Develop and validate tools to estimate residual noise covariance in\nPlanck frequency maps. Quantify signal error effects and compare different\ntechniques to produce low-resolution maps.\n  Methods: We derive analytical estimates of covariance of the residual noise\ncontained in low-resolution maps produced using a number of map-making\napproaches. We test these analytical predictions using Monte Carlo simulations\nand their impact on angular power spectrum estimation. We use simulations to\nquantify the level of signal errors incurred in different resolution\ndowngrading schemes considered in this work.\n  Results: We find an excellent agreement between the optimal residual noise\ncovariance matrices and Monte Carlo noise maps. For destriping map-makers, the\nextent of agreement is dictated by the knee frequency of the correlated noise\ncomponent and the chosen baseline offset length. The significance of signal\nstriping is shown to be insignificant when properly dealt with. In map\nresolution downgrading, we find that a carefully selected window function is\nrequired to reduce aliasing to the sub-percent level at multipoles, ell >\n2Nside, where Nside is the HEALPix resolution parameter. We show that\nsufficient characterization of the residual noise is unavoidable if one is to\ndraw reliable contraints on large scale anisotropy.\n  Conclusions: We have described how to compute the low-resolution maps, with a\ncontrolled sky signal level, and a reliable estimate of covariance of the\nresidual noise. We have also presented a method to smooth the residual noise\ncovariance matrices to describe the noise correlations in smoothed, bandwidth\nlimited maps.",

        "summary": "These last years ground-based astronomy has been looking towards Antarctica,\nespecially its summits and the internal continental plateau where the optical\nturbulence (OT) appears to be confined in a shallow layer close to the surface.\nPreliminary measurements have so far indicated pretty good value for the seeing\nabove 30-35 m: 0.36\" (Agabi et al. 2006), 0.27\" (Lawrence et al. 2004) and 0.3\"\n(Trinquet et al. 2008) at Dome C. Site testing campaigns are however extremely\nexpensive, instruments provide only local measurements and atmospheric modeling\nmight represent a step ahead towards the search and selection of astronomical\nsites thanks to the possibility to reconstruct 3D Cn2 maps over a surface of\nseveral kilometers. The Antarctic Plateau represents therefore an important\nbenchmark test to evaluate the possibility to discriminate sites on the same\nplateau. Our group (Hagelin et al. 2008) has proven that the analyses from the\nECMWF global model do not describe with the required accuracy the antarctic\nboundary and surface layers in the plateau. A better description could be\nobtained with a mesoscale model. The Meso-Nh model has proven to be reliable in\nreproducing 3D maps of OT above mid-latitude astronomical sites (Masciadri et\nal. 1999ab, 2004, Masciadri and Jabouille 2005). In this paper we study the\nability of the Meso-Nh model in reconstructing the meteorological parameters as\nwell as the OT above Dome C with different model configurations. We concentrate\nour attention on the model abilities in reproducing the OT surface layer\nthickness Hsl and the integral of the Cn2 in the free atmosphere and in the\nsurface layer. It is worth to highlight that these are the first estimates ever\ndone so far with a mesoscale model of the optical turbulence above the internal\nAntarctic Plateau.",

        "summary": "Context. Discovery of new variability classes in large surveys using\nmultivariate statistics techniques such as clustering, relies heavily on the\ncorrect understanding of the distribution of known classes as point processes\nin parameter space. Aims. Our objective is to analyze the correspondence\nbetween the classical stellar variability types and the clusters found in the\ndistribution of light curve parameters and colour indices of stars in the CoRoT\nexoplanet sample. The final aim is to help in the identification on new types\nof variability by first identifying the well known variables in the CoRoT\nsample. Methods. We apply unsupervised classification algorithms to identify\nclusters of variable stars from modes of the probability density distribution.\nWe use reference variability databases (Hipparcos and OGLE) as a framework to\ncalibrate the clustering methodology. Furthermore, we use the results from\nsupervised classification methods to interpret the resulting clusters.\nResults.We interpret the clusters in the Hipparcos and OGLE LMC databases in\nterms of large-amplitude radial pulsators in the classical instability strip\nand of various types of eclipsing binaries. The Hipparcos data also provide\nclear distributions for low-amplitude nonradial pulsators. We show that the\npreselection of targets for the CoRoT exoplanet programme results in a\ncompletely different probability density landscape than the OGLE data, the\ninterpretation of which involves mainly classes of low-amplitude variability in\nmain-sequence stars. Our findings will be incorporated to improve the\nsupervised classification used in the CoRoT catalogue production, once the\nexistence of new classes or subtypes will be confirmed from complementary\nspectroscopic observations.",

        "title": "Inelastic Dark Matter and DAMA/LIBRA: An Experimentum Crucis",
        "summary": "The DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has detected an annual modulation of the recoil\nrate in NaI crystals with the phase expected for WIMP scattering events. This\nsignal is dramatically inconsistent with upper limits from other experiments\nfor elastically scattering weak-scale WIMPs. However, the results are\ncompatible for the case of inelastic dark matter (iDM). The iDM theory, as\nimplemented by Tucker-Smith and Weiner, constrains the WIMP to a tight contour\nin sigma_n-delta space, where delta is the mass difference between the ground\nstate and excited WIMPs. An urgent priority in direct detection is to test this\nscenario. The crucial test of the iDM explanation of DAMA -- an \"experimentum\ncrucis\" -- is an experiment with directional sensitivity, which can measure the\ndaily modulation in direction. Because the contrast can be 100%, it is a\nsharper test than the much smaller annual modulation in the rate. We estimate\nthe significance of such an experiment as a function of the WIMP mass, cross\nsection, background rate, and other parameters. The proposed experiment\nseverely constrains the DAMA/iDM scenario even with modest exposure (~1000 kg\nday) on gaseous xenon.",

        "title": "A Multi-wavelength Differential Imaging Experiment for the High Contrast\n  Imaging Testbed",
        "summary": "We discuss the results of a multi-wavelength differential imaging lab\nexperiment with the High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) at the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory. The HCIT combines a Lyot coronagraph with a Xinetics deformable\nmirror in a vacuum environment to simulate a space telescope in order to test\ntechnologies and algorithms for a future exoplanet coronagraph mission. At\npresent, ground based telescopes have achieved significant attenuation of\nspeckle noise using the technique of spectral differential imaging (SDI). We\ntest whether ground-based SDI can be generalized to a non-simultaneous spectral\ndifferential imaging technique (NSDI) for a space mission. In our lab\nexperiment, a series of 5 filter images centered around the O2(A) absorption\nfeature at 0.762 um were acquired at nominal contrast values of 10^-6, 10^-7,\n10^-8, and 10^-9. Outside the dark hole, single differences of images improve\ncontrast by a factor of ~6. Inside the dark hole, we found significant speckle\nchromatism as a function of wavelength offset from the nulling wavelength,\nleading to a contrast degradation by a factor of 7.2 across the entire ~80 nm\nbandwidth. This effect likely stems from the chromatic behavior of the current\nocculter. New, less chromatic occulters are currently in development; we expect\nthat these new occulters will resolve the speckle chromatism issue.",

        "summary": "Many scientific deliverables of the next generation low frequency radio\ntelescopes require high dynamic range imaging. Next generation telescopes under\nconstruction indeed promise at least a ten-fold increase in the sensitivity\ncompared with existing telescopes. The projected achievable RMS noise in the\nimages from these telescopes is in the range of 1--10$\\mu$Jy/beam corresponding\nto typical imaging dynamic ranges of $10^{6-7}$. High imaging dynamic range\nrequire removal of systematic errors to high accuracy and for long integration\nintervals. In general, many source of errors are directionally dependent and\nunless corrected for, will be a limiting factor for the imaging dynamic range\nof these next generation telescopes. This requires development of new\nalgorithms and software for calibration and imaging which can correct for such\ndirection and time dependent errors. In this paper, I discuss the resulting\nalgorithmic and computing challenges and the recent progress made towards\naddressing these challenges.",

The detector's response can lead directly\nto a calculation of the conversion gain (e^- ADU^{-1}), as well as aid detector\ndesign and performance studies. We calibrate the ^{55}Fe X-ray energy response\nand pair production energy of HgCdTe using 8 HST WFC3 1.7 \\micron flight grade\ndetectors. The results show that each K$\\alpha$ X-ray generates 2273 \\pm 137\nelectrons, which corresponds to a pair-production energy of 2.61 \\pm 0.16 eV.\nThe uncertainties are dominated by our knowledge of the conversion gain. In\nfuture studies, we plan to eliminate this uncertainty by directly measuring\nconversion gain at very low light levels.",

        "summary": "In these lectures I cover a number of topics in cosmological data analysis. I\nconcentrate on general techniques which are common in cosmology, or techniques\nwhich have been developed in a cosmological context. In fact they have very\ngeneral applicability, for problems in which the data are interpreted in the\ncontext of a theoretical model, and thus lend themselves to a Bayesian\ntreatment.\n  We consider the general problem of estimating parameters from data, and\nconsider how one can use Fisher matrices to analyse survey designs before any\ndata are taken, to see whether the survey will actually do what is required. We\noutline numerical methods for estimating parameters from data, including Monte\nCarlo Markov Chains and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We also look at\nModel Selection, which covers various scenarios such as whether an extra\nparameter is preferred by the data, or answering wider questions such as which\ntheoretical framework is favoured, using General Relativity and braneworld\ngravity as an example. These notes are not a literature review, so there are\nrelatively few references.",

        "summary": "We emphasize that the mention of the significance level when rejecting the\nnull hypothesis (H0) which assumes that what is observed is pure noise) can\nmislead one to think that the H0 hypothesis is unlikely to occur with that\nsignificance level. We show that the significance level has nothing to do with\nthe posterior probability of H0 given the observed data set, and that this\nposterior probability is very much higher than what the significance level\nnaively provides. We use Bayes theorem for deriving the posterior probability\nof H0 being true assuming an alternative hypothesis H1 that assumes that a mode\nis present, taking some prior for the mode height, for the mode amplitude and\nlinewidth.We report the posterior probability of H0 for the p modes detected on\nHD49933 by CoRoT. We conclude that the posterior probability of H0 provide a\nmuch more conservative quantification of the mode detection than the\nsignificance level. This framework can be applied to any stellar power spectra\nsimilar to those obtained for asteroseismology.",

The synergy with\nFermi's GBM detectors will link these observations to those in the well\nexplored 10-1000 keV range; the addition of the > 100 MeV band observations\nwill resolve theoretical uncertainties about burst emission in both the prompt\nand afterglow phases. Trigger algorithms will be applied to the LAT data both\nonboard the spacecraft and on the ground. The sensitivity of these triggers\nwill differ because of the available computing resources onboard and on the\nground. Here we present the LAT's burst detection methodologies and the\ninstrument's GRB capabilities.",

It is open source, rigorously designed and tested and\nincludes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with automated LATEX file creation\ncapability and point-and-click Fisher ellipse generation. Fisher4Cast was\ndesigned for ease of extension and, although written in Matlab, is easily\nportable to open-source alternatives such as Octave and Scilab. Here we use\nFisher4Cast to present new 3-D and 4-D visualisations of the forecasting\nlandscape and to investigate the effects of growth and curvature on future\ncosmological surveys. Early releases have been available at\nhttp://www.cosmology.org.za since May 2008 with 750 downloads in the first\nyear. Version 2.2 is made public with this paper and includes a Quick Start\nguide and the code used to produce the figures in this paper, in the hope that\nit will be useful to the cosmology and wider scientific communities.",

        "title": "Photometric Redshift Estimation Using Spectral Connectivity Analysis",
        "summary": "The development of fast and accurate methods of photometric redshift\nestimation is a vital step towards being able to fully utilize the data of\nnext-generation surveys within precision cosmology. In this paper we apply a\nspecific approach to spectral connectivity analysis (SCA; Lee & Wasserman 2009)\ncalled diffusion map. SCA is a class of non-linear techniques for transforming\nobserved data (e.g., photometric colours for each galaxy, where the data lie on\na complex subset of p-dimensional space) to a simpler, more natural coordinate\nsystem wherein we apply regression to make redshift predictions. As SCA relies\nupon eigen-decomposition, our training set size is limited to ~ 10,000\ngalaxies; we use the Nystrom extension to quickly estimate diffusion\ncoordinates for objects not in the training set. We apply our method to 350,738\nSDSS main sample galaxies, 29,816 SDSS luminous red galaxies, and 5,223\ngalaxies from DEEP2 with CFHTLS ugriz photometry. For all three datasets, we\nachieve prediction accuracies on par with previous analyses, and find that use\nof the Nystrom extension leads to a negligible loss of prediction accuracy\nrelative to that achieved with the training sets. As in some previous analyses\n(e.g., Collister & Lahav 2004, Ball et al. 2008), we observe that our\npredictions are generally too high (low) in the low (high) redshift regimes. We\ndemonstrate that this is a manifestation of attenuation bias, wherein\nmeasurement error (i.e., uncertainty in diffusion coordinates due to\nuncertainty in the measured fluxes/magnitudes) reduces the slope of the\nbest-fit regression line. Mitigation of this bias is necessary if we are to use\nphotometric redshift estimates produced by computationally efficient empirical\nmethods in precision cosmology.",

The ACC needs to\ndetect particles that enter or exit the tracker through the sides with an\nefficiency of better than 99.99 %. This allows to reject particles that have\nnot passed through all the subdetectors and may confuse the charge and momentum\nmeasurements which is important for an improvement of the\nantinuclei-measurements.\n  In 2007/2008 all subdetectors were integrated into the AMS-02 experiment and\natmospheric muons were collected. These data were used to determine the ACC\ndetection efficiency.",

        "title": "Submillimeter Number Counts From Statistical Analysis of BLAST Maps",
        "summary": "We describe the application of a statistical method to estimate submillimeter\ngalaxy number counts from confusion limited observations by the Balloon-borne\nLarge Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST). Our method is based on a\nmaximum likelihood fit to the pixel histogram, sometimes called 'P(D)', an\napproach which has been used before to probe faint counts, the difference being\nthat here we advocate its use even for sources with relatively high\nsignal-to-noise ratios. This method has an advantage over standard techniques\nof source extraction in providing an unbiased estimate of the counts from the\nbright end down to flux densities well below the confusion limit. We\nspecifically analyse BLAST observations of a roughly 10 sq. deg. map centered\non the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We\nprovide estimates of number counts at the three BLAST wavelengths, 250, 350,\nand 500 microns; instead of counting sources in flux bins we estimate the\ncounts at several flux density nodes connected with power-laws. We observe a\ngenerally very steep slope for the counts of about -3.7 at 250 microns and -4.5\nat 350 and 500 microns, over the range ~0.02-0.5 Jy, breaking to a shallower\nslope below about 0.015 Jy at all three wavelengths. We also describe how to\nestimate the uncertainties and correlations in this method so that the results\ncan be used for model-fitting. This method should be well-suited for analysis\nof data from the Herschel satellite.",

We describe the first results of a comprehensive\nanalysis of the weather data measured in situ from October 2000 to February\n2008 to be used as a reference for future activity in the site. We compare the\ndata from two different stations at the summit considering the accuracy of both\ninstruments. We analysed the diurnal, seasonal and annual cycles for all the\nparameters. The thermal stability is remarkably good, crucial for a good\nperformance of the telescopes. From the solar radiation data we developed a new\nmethod to estimate the fraction of time when the sky is clear of clouds. We\nshow that our measurements are consistent with a warm standard atmosphere\nmodel.

        "summary": "Measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy have served as\nthe best experimental probe of the early universe to date. The inflationary\nparadigm, inspired in part by the extreme isotropy of the CMB, is now a\ncornerstone in modern cosmology. Inflation has passed a series of rigorous\nexperimental tests, but we still do not understand the physical mechanism or\nenergy scale behind inflation. A general prediction of inflation and one that\ncan provide certain insights into inflationary physics is a background of\nprimordial gravitational waves. These perturbations leave a distinct signature\nin the CMB B-modes of polarization. The EPIC (Experimental Probe of\nInflationary Cosmology) study team has investigated several CMB polarization\nmission concepts to carry out a definitive measurement of the inflationary\nB-mode polarization spectrum. In this report we study a mission with an\naperture intermediate between the two missions discussed in our previous\nreport. EPIC-IM's increased aperture allows access to a broader science case\nthan the small EPIC-Low Cost mission. In addition to the search for\ninflationary gravitational waves, the increase aperture allows us to mine the\nscale polarization and lensing shear polarization signals down to cosmological\nlimits, so that we extract virtually all the cosmological information available\nfrom the CMB. In addition, a modest number of channels operating at higher\nfrequencies allows for an all-sky measurement of polarized Galactic dust, which\nwill provide a rich dataset for Galactic science related to magnetic fields.\nUsing a combination of a large sensitivity focal plane with a new optical\ndesign, and an efficient 4K mechanical cooler, EPIC-IM realizes higher\nsensitivity than EPIC-Comprehensive Science mission.",

        "summary": "This paper describes a near-UV/VIS study of a pyrene:H_2O interstellar ice\nanalogue at 10 K using optical absorption spectroscopy. A new experimental\napproach makes it possible to irradiate the sample with vacuum ultraviolet\n(VUV) light (7-10.5 eV) while simultaneously recording spectra in the 240-1000\nnm range with subsecond time resolution. Both spectroscopic and dynamic\ninformation on VUV processed ices are obtained in this way. This provides a\npowerful tool to follow, in-situ and in real time, the photophysical and\nphotochemical processes induced by VUV irradiation of a polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon containing inter- and circumstellar ice analogue. Results on the\nVUV photolysis of a prototype sample - strongly diluted pyrene in H_2O ice -\nare presented. In addition to the pyrene cation (Py+), other products -\nhydroxypyrene (PyOH), possibly hydroxypyrene cation (PyOH+), and\npyrene/pyrenolate anion (Py-/PyO-) - are observed. It is found that the charge\nremains localized in the ice, also after the VUV irradiation is stopped. The\nastrochemical implications and observational constraints are discussed.",

Anatase\n(TiO$_2$) particles with rounded edges are the possible 13, 19.5 and 28 $\\mu$m\nband carriers as the main contributor in the spectra of AGB stars, and\nspherically shaped nano-sized spinel and Al$_2$TiO$_5$ dust grains are possibly\nassociated with the anatase, enhancing the prominence of the 13 $\\mu$m feature\nand providing additional features at 28 $\\mu$m.

        "summary": "We introduce a general range of science drivers for using the Virtual\nObservatory (VO) and identify some common aspects to these as well as the\nadvantages of VO data access. We then illustrate the use of existing VO tools\nto tackle multi wavelength science problems. We demonstrate the ease of multi\nmission data access using the VOExplorer resource browser, as provided by\nAstroGrid (http://www.astrogrid.org) and show how to pass the various results\ninto any VO enabled tool such as TopCat for catalogue correlation. VOExplorer\noffers a powerful data-centric visualisation for browsing and filtering the\nentire VO registry using an iTunes type interface. This allows the user to\nbookmark their own personalised lists of resources and to run tasks on the\nselected resources as desired. We introduce an example of how more advanced\nquerying can be performed to access existing X-ray cluster of galaxies\ncatalogues and then select extended only X-ray sources as candidate clusters of\ngalaxies in the 2XMMi catalogue. Finally we introduce scripted access to VO\nresources using python with AstroGrid and demonstrate how the user can pass on\nthe results of such a search and correlate with e.g. optical datasets such as\nSloan. Hence we illustrate the power of enabling large scale data mining of\nmulti wavelength resources in an easily reproducible way using the VO.",

We\npresent the development of a visualization software for solar physics data\nbased on the JPEG 2000 image compression standard. Our implementation consists\nof the JHelioviewer client application that enables users to browse\npetabyte-scale image archives and the JHelioviewer server, which integrates a\nJPIP server, metadata catalog and an event server. JPEG 2000 offers many useful\nnew features and has the potential to revolutionize the way high-resolution\nimage data are disseminated and analyzed. This is especially relevant for solar\nphysics, a research field in which upcoming space missions will provide more\nthan a terabyte of image data per day. Providing efficient access to such large\ndata volumes at both high spatial and high time resolution is of paramount\nimportance to support scientific discovery.",

Looking more\ncarefully, however, one realises that the truth is perhaps not as glamorous as\none would hope, and that, although well present in the media, astronomy's\ncoverage is rather tiny, and often, limited to the specialised pages or\nmagazines.",

        "summary": "We propose an X-ray mission called Xenia to search for decaying superweakly\ninteracting Dark Matter particles (super-WIMP) with a mass in the keV range.\nThe mission and its observation plan are capable of providing a major break\nthrough in our understanding of the nature of Dark Matter (DM). It will\nconfirm, or reject, predictions of a number of particle physics models by\nincreasing the sensitivity of the search for decaying DM by about two orders of\nmagnitude through a wide-field imaging X-ray spectrometer in combination with a\ndedicated observation program.\n  The proposed mission will provide unique limits on the mixing angle and mass\nof neutral leptons, right handed partners of neutrinos, which are important\nDark Matter candidates. The existence of these particles is strongly motivated\nby observed neutrino flavor oscillations and the problem of baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe.\n  In super-WIMP models, the details of the formation of the cosmic web are\ndifferent from those of LambdaCDM. The proposed mission will, in addition to\nthe search for decaying Dark Matter, provide crucial insight into the nature of\nDM by studying the structure of the \"cosmic web\". This will be done by\nsearching for missing baryons in emission, and by using gamma-ray bursts as\nbacklight to observe the warm-hot intergalactic media in absorption.",

        "summary": "Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) are inexpensive commodity hardware\nthat offer Tflop/s theoretical computing capacity. GPUs are well suited to many\ncompute-intensive tasks including digital signal processing.\n  We describe the implementation and performance of a GPU-based digital\ncorrelator for radio astronomy. The correlator is implemented using the NVIDIA\nCUDA development environment. We evaluate three design options on two\ngenerations of NVIDIA hardware. The different designs utilize the internal\nregisters, shared memory and multiprocessors in different ways. We find that\noptimal performance is achieved with the design that minimizes global memory\nreads on recent generations of hardware.\n  The GPU-based correlator outperforms a single-threaded CPU equivalent by a\nfactor of 60 for a 32 antenna array, and runs on commodity PC hardware. The\nextra compute capability provided by the GPU maximises the correlation\ncapability of a PC while retaining the fast development time associated with\nusing standard hardware, networking and programming languages. In this way, a\nGPU-based correlation system represents a middle ground in design space between\nhigh performance, custom built hardware and pure CPU-based software\ncorrelation.\n  The correlator was deployed at the Murchison Widefield Array 32 antenna\nprototype system where it ran in real-time for extended periods. We briefly\ndescribe the data capture, streaming and correlation system for the prototype\narray.",

We present results of automatic detection and\nsegmentation of Jupiter's auroral emissions as observed by HST ACS instrument\nwith VOronoi Image SEgmentation (VOISE). VOISE is a dynamic algorithm for\npartitioning the underlying pixel grid of an image into regions according to a\nprescribed homogeneity criterion. The algorithm consists of an iterative\nprocedure that dynamically constructs a tessellation of the image plane based\non a Voronoi Diagram, until the intensity of the underlying image within each\nregion is classified as homogeneous. The computed tessellations allow the\nextraction of quantitative information about the auroral features such as mean\nintensity, latitudinal and longitudinal extents and length scales. These\noutputs thus represent a more automated and objective method of characterising\nauroral emissions than manual inspection.",

The Mirror\nMOS is based on a sequence of mirrors that enables low-loss propagation of\nbeams from selected positions distributed throughout the focal plane to the\nspectroscopic receiver inputs. This approach should be useful for observations\nof sources which have a relatively low density on the sky, for which it is\ninefficient to use a traditional array receiver with uniformly spaced,\nrelatively closely packed beams. Our concept is based on assigning a patrol\nregion to each of the receivers, which have inputs distributed over the focal\nplane of the telescope. The input to each receiver can be positioned at any\npoint within this patrol region. This approach, with only 4 reflections, offers\nvery low loss. The Gaussian beam optical system can be designed to produce\nfrequency-independent illumination of the telescope, which is an important\nadvantage for broadband systems such those required for determination of\nredshifts of submillimeter galaxies.",

We created datasets of synthetic Stokes profiles for the case of\nquiescent prominences (B<200 G), assuming a conservative value of 10^-3 of the\npeak intensity for the polarimetric sensitivity of the simulated observations.\nIn this work, we focus on the error analysis for the inference of the magnetic\nfield vector, under the usual assumption that the prominence can be assimilated\nto a slab of finite optical thickness with uniform magnetic and thermodynamic\nproperties. We find that the simultaneous inversion of the two lines\nsignificantly reduces the errors on the inference of the magnetic field vector,\nwith respect to the case of single-line inversion. These results provide a\nsolid justification for current and future instrumental efforts with multi-line\ncapabilities for the observations of solar prominences and filaments.",

If used correctly, it can be a powerful approach,\nholding the potential to fully exploit the exponentially increasing amount of\navailable data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can\nbe little more than the black-box application of complex computing algorithms\nthat may give little physical insight, and provide questionable results. Here,\nwe give an overview of the entire data mining process, from data collection\nthrough to the interpretation of results. We cover common machine learning\nalgorithms, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines,\napplications from a broad range of astronomy, emphasizing those where data\nmining techniques directly resulted in improved science, and important current\nand future directions, including probability density functions, parallel\nalgorithms, petascale computing, and the time domain.

        "title": "Detecting planetary geochemical cycles on exoplanets: Atmospheric\n  signatures and the case of SO2",
        "summary": "We study the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere to derive detectable features\nin low resolution of different global geochemical cycles on exoplanets - using\nthe sulphur cycle as our example. We derive low resolution detectable features\nfor first generation space- and ground- based telescopes as a first step in\ncomparative planetology. We assume that the surfaces and atmospheres of\nterrestrial exoplanets (Earth-like and super-Earths) will most often be\ndominated by a specific geochemical cycle. Here we concentrate on the sulphur\ncycle driven by outgassing of SO2 and H2S followed by their transformation to\nother sulphur-bearing species which is clearly distinguishable from the carbon\ncycle which is driven by outgassing of CO2. Due to increased volcanism, the\nsulphur cycle is potentially the dominant global geochemical cycle on dry\nsuper-Earths with active tectonics. We calculate planetary emission, reflection\nand transmission spectrum from 0.4 to 40 micrometer with high and low\nresolution to assess detectable features using current and Archean Earth models\nwith varying SO2 and H2S concentrations to explore reducing and oxidizing\nhabitable environments on rocky planets. We find specific spectral signatures\nthat are observable with low resolution in a planetary atmosphere with high SO2\nand H2S concentration. Therefore first generation space and ground based\ntelescopes can test our understanding of geochemical cycles on rocky planets\nand potentially distinguish planetary environments dominated by the carbon and\nsulphur cycle.",

        "summary": "Adaptive optics will almost completely remove the effects of atmospheric\nturbulence at 10 microns on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) generation of\ntelescopes. In this paper, we observationally confirm that the next most\nimportant limitation to image quality is atmospheric dispersion, rather than\ntelescope diffraction. By using the 6.5 meter MMT with its unique mid-IR\nadaptive optics system, we measure atmospheric dispersion in the N-band with\nthe newly commissioned spectroscopic mode on MIRAC4-BLINC. Our results indicate\nthat atmospheric dispersion is generally linear in the N-band, although there\nis some residual curvature. We compare our measurements to theory, and make\npredictions for ELT Strehls and image FHWM with and without an atmospheric\ndispersion corrector (ADC). We find that for many mid-IR applications, an ADC\nwill be necessary on ELTs.",

After a decade rich\nin giant exoplanet detections, observation techniques have now reached the\nability to find planets of less than 10 MEarth (so called Super-Earths) that\nmay potentially be habitable. How can we characterize those planets and assess\nif they are habitable? The new field of extrasolar planet search has shown an\nextraordinary ability to combine research by astrophysics, chemistry, biology\nand geophysics into a new and exciting interdisciplinary approach to understand\nour place in the universe. The results of a first generation mission will most\nlikely result in an amazing scope of diverse planets that will set planet\nformation, evolution as well as our planet in an overall context.",

        "summary": "The radio spectrum is a finite and increasingly precious resource for\nastronomical research, as well as for other spectrum users. Keeping the\nfrequency bands used for radio astronomy as free as possible of unwanted Radio\nFrequency Interference (RFI) is crucial. The aim of spectrum management, one of\nthe tools used towards achieving this goal, includes setting regulatory limits\non RFI levels emitted by other spectrum users into the radio astronomy\nfrequency bands. This involves discussions with regulatory bodies and other\nspectrum users at several levels - national, regional and worldwide. The global\nframework for spectrum management is set by the Radio Regulations of the\nInternational Telecommunication Union, which has defined that interference is\ndetrimental to radio astronomy if it increases the uncertainty of a measurement\nby 10%. The Radio Regulations are revised every three to four years, a process\nin which four organisations representing the interests of the radio\nastronomical community in matters of spectrum management (IUCAF, CORF, CRAF and\nRAFCAP) participate actively. The current interests and activities of these\nfour organisations range from preserving what has been achieved through\nregulatory measures, to looking far into the future of high frequency use and\ngiant radio telescope use.",

Since angles are deduced from the baseline and\ndelay side of these triangles, length and pointing direction (in the celestial\nsphere) of the baseline vector at the time of observation are key input data.\nWe assume that calibration follows from reverse astrometry; a set of calibrator\nstars with well-known positions is observed and inaccuracies in these positions\nare leveled by observing many of them for a common best fit.\n  The errors in baseline length and orientation angles drop proportional to the\ninverse square roots of the number of independent data taken, proportional to\nthe errors in the individual snapshots of the delay, and proportional to the\nerrors in the apparent positions of the calibrators. Scheduling becomes\nimportant if the baseline components are reconstructed from the sinusoidal\ndelay of a single calibrator as a function of time.",

        "summary": "We consider the effects of mutual transits by extrasolar planet-companion\nsystems (in a true binary or a planet-satellite system) on light curves. We\nshow that induced changes in light curves depend strongly on a ratio between a\nplanet-companion's orbital velocity around their host star and a\nplanet-companion's spin speed around their common center of mass. In both the\nslow and fast spin cases (corresponding to long and short distances between\nthem, respectively), a certain asymmetry appears in light curves. We show that,\nespecially in the case of short distances, occultation of one faint object by\nthe other, while the transit of the planet-companion system occurs in front of\nits parent star, causes an apparent increase in light curves and characteristic\nfluctuations appear as important evidence of mutual transits. We show also that\nextrasolar mutual transits provide a complementary method of measuring the\nradii of two transiting objects, their separation and mass, and consequently\nidentifying them as a true binary, planet-satellite system or others.\nMonitoring $10^5$ stars for three years with Kepler may lead to a discovery of\na second Earth-Moon-like system if the fraction of such systems for an averaged\nstar is larger than 0.05, or it may put upper limits on the fraction as f <\n0.05.",

Results from data simulated to\ntest our method are presented, which demonstrate that at least a 10-fold\nimprovement is achievable over that of extracting the image parameters,\nposition and flux, from the equivalent data in the form of pixel maps. Our\nmethod achieves this improvement by analysing the original scan data and\nperforming a combined, iterative solution for the image parameters. This\napproach allows for a full and detailed account of the point-spread function,\nor beam profile, of the instrument. Additionally, the positional information\nfrom different frequency channels may be combined to provide the flux-detection\naccuracy at each frequency for the same sky position. Ultimately, a final check\nand correction of the geometric calibration of the instrument may also be\nincluded. The {\\it Planck} mission was used as the basis for our simulations,\nbut our method will be beneficial for most scanning satellite missions,\nespecially those with non-circularly symmetric point-spread functions.",

        "summary": "Gemini North adaptive optics imaging spectroscopy is presented for the\nGalactic ultra-compact HII (UCHII) region K3-50A. Data were obtained in the\nK-band using the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) behind the\nfacility adaptive optics module ALTAIR in natural guide star mode. The NIFS\ndata cube reveals a complex spatial morphology across the 0.1 pc scale of the\n3'' UCHII region. Comparison of the nebular emission to Cloudy ionization\nmodels shows that the central source must have an effective temperature between\nabout 37000 K and 45000 K with preferred values near 40000 K. Evidence is\npresented for sharp density variations in the nebula which are interpreted as a\nclearing of material nearest the central source. High excitation lines of FeIII\nand SeIV show that the ionization of the nebula clearly changes with distance\nfrom the central source. A double lobed kinematic signature (+/- 25 kms) is\nevident in the Br gamma line map which may be related to the larger scale\nionized flow detailed in earlier investigations. This signature and the large\nscale flow are not co-alighned, but they may still be related. Though clearly\nresolved from the nebula, the central source itself remains buried, and the\nNIFS spectrum shows no evidence of photospheric lines.",

Both telescopes slew relatively fast, being able to point to a new\ntarget field within about 1 min upon a request. Whenever available, the 2.16-m\nNAOC telescope is also used. In 2006, the system responded to 15 GRBs and\ndetected seven early afterglows. In 2007, six GRBs have been detected among 18\nfollow-up observations. TNT observations of the second most distant GRB 060927\n(z=5.5) are shown, which started as early as 91s after the GRB trigger. The\nafterglow was detected in the combined image of first 19x20s unfiltered\nexposures. This GRB follow-up system has joined the East-Asia GRB Follow-up\nObservation Network (EAFON).",

        "title": "Speckle Suppression Through Dual Imaging Polarimetry, and a Ground-Based\n  Image of the HR 4796A Circumstellar Disk",
        "summary": "We demonstrate the versatility of a dual imaging polarimeter working in\ntandem with a Lyot coronagraph and Adaptive Optics to suppress the highly\nstatic speckle noise pattern--the greatest hindrance to ground-based direct\nimaging of planets and disks around nearby stars. Using a double difference\ntechnique with the polarimetric data, we quantify the level of speckle\nsuppression, and hence improved sensitivity, by placing an ensemble of\nartificial faint companions into real data, with given total brightness and\npolarization. For highly polarized sources within 0.5 arcsec, we show that we\nachieve 3 to 4 magnitudes greater sensitivity through polarimetric speckle\nsuppression than simply using a coronagraph coupled to a high-order Adaptive\nOptics system. Using such a polarimeter with a classical Lyot coronagraph at\nthe 3.63m AEOS telescope, we have obtained a 6.5 sigma detection in the H-band\nof the 76 AU diameter circumstellar debris disk around the star HR 4796A. Our\ndata represent the first definitive, ground-based, near-IR polarimetric image\nof the HR 4796A debris disk and clearly show the two outer ansae of the disk,\nevident in Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS/STIS imaging. We derive a lower limit\nto the fractional linear polarization of 29% caused by dust grains in the disk.\nIn addition, we fit simple morphological models of optically thin disks to our\ndata allowing us to constrain the dust disk scale height to 2.5{+5.0}_{-1.3} AU\nand scattering asymmetry parameter (g=0.20^{+.07}_{-.10}). These values are\nconsistent with several lines of evidence suggesting that the HR 4796A disk is\ndominated by a micron-sized dust population, and are indeed typical of disks in\ntransition between those surrounding the Herbig Ae stars to those associated\nwith Vega-like stars.",

        "summary": "We present an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of frame selection\n(also known as Lucky Imaging) techniques for high resolution imaging. A\nhigh-speed image recording system has been used to observe a number of bright\nstars. The observations were made over a wide range of values of D/r0 and\nexposure time. The improvement in Strehl ratio of the stellar images due to\naligning frames and selecting the best frames was evaluated as a function of\nthese parameters. We find that improvement in Strehl ratio by factors of 4 to 6\ncan be achieved over a range of D/r0 from 3 to 12, with a slight peak at D/r0 ~\n7. The best Strehl improvement is achieved with exposure times of 10 ms or less\nbut significant improvement is still obtained at exposure times as long as 640\nms. Our results are consistent with previous investigations but cover a much\nwider range of parameter space. We show that Strehl ratios of >0.7 can be\nachieved in appropiate conditions whereas previous studies have generally shown\nmaximum Strehl ratios of ~0.3. The results are in reasonable agreement with the\nsimulations of Baldwin et al. (2008).",

For\nsimplicity, the field is treated as a split monopole under the assumptions that\nit has been radially combed by the wind, and rotation is not playing a central\nrole. Invoking the weak-field approximation, we find that the V profile has a\ncharacteristic ``heartbeat'' shape exhibiting multiple sign inversions, which\nmight be mistaken for noise in the absence of theoretical guidance. We also\nconclude that there is a tendency for the V profile to integrate to zero on\neach side of the line separately.",

        "summary": "The imminent availability of large arrays of large light collectors deployed\nto exploit atmospheric Cherenkov radiation for gamma-ray astronomy at more than\n100GeV, motivates the growing interest in application of intensity\ninterferometry in astronomy. Indeed, planned arrays numbering up to one hundred\ntelescopes will offer close to 5,000 baselines, ranging from less than 50m to\nmore than 1000m. Recent and continuing signal processing technology\ndevelopments reinforce this interest. Revisiting Stellar Intensity\nInterferometry for imaging is well motivated scientifically. It will fill the\nshort wavelength (B/V bands) and high angular resolution (< 0.1mas) gap left\nopen by amplitude interferometers. It would also constitute a first and\nimportant step toward exploiting quantum optics for astronomical observations,\nthus leading the way for future observatories. In this paper we outline science\ncases, technical approaches and schedule for an intensity interferometer to be\nconstructed and operated in the visible using gamma-ray astronomy Air Cherenkov\nTelescopes as receivers.",

The fluctuations of the sodium\nlayer altitude and atom density profile induce errors on centroid measurements\nof elongated spots, and generate spurious optical aberrations in closed--loop\nadaptive optics (AO) systems. According to an analytical model and experimental\nresults obtained with the University of Victoria LGS bench demonstrator, one of\nthe main origins of these aberrations, referred to as LGS aberrations, is not\nthe Centre-of-Gravity (CoG) algorithm itself, but the thresholding applied on\nthe pixels of the image prior to computing the spot centroids.

        "summary": "Among the group of extrasolar planets, transiting planets provide a great\nopportunity to obtain direct measurements for the basic physical properties,\nsuch as mass and radius of these objects. These planets are therefore highly\nimportant in the understanding of the evolution and formation of planetary\nsystems: from the observations of photometric transits, the interior structure\nof the planet and atmospheric properties can also be constrained. The most\nefficient way to search for transiting extrasolar planets is based on\nwide-field surveys by hunting for short and shallow periodic dips in light\ncurves covering quite long time intervals. These surveys monitor fields with\nseveral degrees in diameter and tens or hundreds of thousands of objects\nsimultaneously. In the practice of astronomical observations, surveys of large\nfield-of-view are rather new and therefore require special methods for\nphotometric data reduction that have not been used before. In this PhD thesis,\nI summarize my efforts related to the development of a complete software\nsolution for high precision photometric reduction of astronomical images. I\nalso demonstrate the role of this newly developed package and the related\nalgorithms in the case of particular discoveries of the HATNet project.\n[abridged]",

        "summary": "Charge-transfer loss on the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) onboard the\nHubble Space Telescope is a primary source of uncertainty in stellar photometry\nobtained with this camera. This effect, discovered shortly after the camera was\ninstalled, has grown over time and can dim stars by several tenths of a\nmagnitude (or even more, in particularly bad cases). The impact of CTE loss on\nWFPC2 stellar photometry was characterized by several studies between 1998 and\n2000, but has received diminished attention since ACS became HST's primary\nimager. After the failure of ACS in January 2007, WFPC2 once again became the\nprimary imaging instrument onboard HST, restoring the importance of ensuring\naccurate CTE corrections.\n  This paper re-examines the CTE loss of WFPC2, with three significant changes\nover previous studies. First, the present study considers calibration data\nobtained through 2007, thus increasing the confidence in the reliability of the\nCTE corrections when applied to recent observations. Second, the change in CTE\nloss during readout is accounted for analytically. Finally, a reanalysis of the\nCTE dependencies on counts, background, and observation date was made. The\nresulting correction is significantly more accurate than that provided in the\nWFPC2 Instrument Handbook (Dolphin 2002 and updates through 2004), resulting in\nphotometry that can be enhanced by over 5% in certain circumstances.",

We argue that high\nresolution X-ray spectra as enabled by the Chandra and XMM-Newton gratings\nshould be considered a powerful and viable new resource for delving into a\nrelatively unexplored regime for directly determining dust properties:\ncomposition, quantity, and distribution. We present initial cross-section\nmeasurements of astrophysically likely iron-based dust candidates taken at the\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Advanced Light Source synchrotron\nbeamline, as an illustrative tool for the formulation of our methodology.\nFocused at the 700eV Fe LIII and LII photoelectric edges, we discuss a\ntechnique for modeling dust properties in the soft X-rays using L-edge data, to\ncomplement K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure analysis techniques discussed\nin Lee & Ravel 2005. This is intended to be *a techniques paper* of interest\nand usefulness to both condensed matter experimentalists and astrophysicists.\nFor the experimentalists, we offer a new prescription for normalizing\nrelatively low S/N L-edge cross section measurements. For astrophysics\ninterests, we discuss the use of X-ray absorption spectra for determining dust\ncomposition in cold and ionized astrophysical environments, and a new method\nfor determining *species-specific gas-to-dust ratios*. Possible astrophysical\napplications of interest, are offered. Prospects for improving on this work\nwith future X-ray missions with higher throughput and spectral resolution are\npresented in the context of spectral resolution goals for gratings and\ncalorimeters, for proposed and planned missions such as Astro-H and the\nInternational X-ray Observatory.",

        "summary": "In a previous publication (Richichi & Percheron 2005) we described a program\nof observations of candidate calibrator stars at the ESO Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer (VLTI), and presented the main results from a statistical point\nof view. In the present paper, we concentrate on establishing a new homogeneous\ngroup of bright interferometric calibrators, based entirely on publicly\navailable K-band VLTI observations carried out with the VINCI instrument up to\nJuly 2004. For this, we have defined a number of selection criteria for the\nquality and volume of the observations, and we have accordingly selected a list\nof 17 primary and 47 secondary calibrators. We have developed an approach to a\nrobust global fit for the angular diameters using the whole volume of\nquality-controlled data, largely independent of a priori assumptions. Our\nresults have been compared with direct measurements, and indirect estimates\nbased on spectrophotometric methods, and general agreement is found within the\ncombined uncertainties. The stars in our list cover the range K=-2.9 to +3.0\nmag in brightness, and 1.3 to 20.5 milliarcseconds in uniform-disk diameter.\nThe relative accuracy of the angular diameter values is on average 0.4% and 2%\nfor the primary and secondary calibrators respectively. Our calibrators are\nwell suited for interferometric observations in the near-infrared on baselines\nbetween ~20m and ~200m, and their accuracy is superior, at least for the\nprimary calibrators, to other similar catalogues. Therefore, the present list\nof calibrators has the potential to lead to significantly improved\ninterferometric scientific results.",

We have derived over an area of\n~0.4 sq. deg. the galaxy number counts down to U=27 in the Vega system\n(corresponding to U=27.86 in the AB system) at a completeness level of 30%\nreaching the faintest current limit for this wavelength and sky area. The shape\nof the galaxy counts in the U band can be described by a double power-law, the\nbright side being consistent with the shape of shallower surveys of comparable\nor greater areas. The slope bends over significantly at U>23.5 ensuring the\nconvergence of the contribution by star forming galaxies to the EBL in the\nnear-UV band to a value which is more than 70% of the most recent upper limits\nderived for this band. We have jointly compared our near-UV and K band counts\ncollected from the literature with few selected hierarchical CDM models\nemphasizing critical issues in the physical description of the galaxy formation\nand evolution.",

        "title": "Kinematic analysis and membership status of TWA22ABR",
        "summary": "TWA22 was initially regarded as a member of the TW Hydrae association (TWA).\nIn addition to being one of the youngest (~8Myr) and nearest (~20pc) stars to\nEarth, TWA22 has proven to be very interesting after being resolved as a tight,\nvery low-mass binary. This binary can serve as a very useful dynamical\ncalibrator for pre-main sequence evolutionary models. However, its membership\nin the TWA has been recently questioned despite due to the lack of accurate\nkinematic measurements.\n  Based on proper motion, radial velocity, and trigonometric parallax\nmeasurements, we aim here to re-analyze the membership of TWA22 to young,\nnearby associations.\n  Using the ESO NTT/SUSI2 telescope, we observed TWA22AB during 5 different\nobserving runs over 1.2 years to measure its trigonometric parallax and proper\nmotion. This is a part of a larger project measuring trigonometric parallaxes\nand proper motions of most known TWA members at a sub-milliarcsec level. HARPS\nat the ESO 3.6m telescope was also used to measure the system's radial velocity\nover 2 years.\n  We report an absolute trigonometric parallax of TWA22AB, 57.0mas,\ncorresponding to a distance 17.5pc from Earth. Measured proper motions of\nTWA22AB are -175.8mas/yr in right ascension and -21.3mas/yr in declination.\nFinally, from HARPS measurements, we obtain a radial velocity 14.8km/s.",

We perform a test for statistically significant QPO\ndetection in XTE J1550--564 microquasar and active galaxy of RE J1034+396\nconfirming these results in the wavelet domain with our method.

        "summary": "We present the SVOM (Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object\nMonitor) mission, that is being developed in cooperation between the Chinese\nNational Space Agency (CNSA), the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) and the\nFrench Space Agency (CNES). Its scientific objectives include the study of the\nGRB phenomenon, GRB physics and progenitors, cosmology, and fundamental\nphysics. SVOM is designed to detect all known types of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs),\nto provide fast and reliable GRB positions, to measure the broadband spectral\ncharacteristics and temporal properties of the GRB prompt emission. This will\nbe obtained in first place thanks to a set of four space flown instruments. A\nwide field (~2 sr) coded mask telescope (ECLAIRs), operating in the 4-250 keV\nenergy range, will provide the triggers and localizations, while a gamma-ray\nnon-imaging spectrometer (GRM), sensitive in the 50 keV-5 MeV domain, will\nextend the prompt emission energy coverage. After a satellite slew, in order to\nplace the GRB direction within field of view of the two narrow field\ninstruments - a soft X-ray (XIAO), and a visible telescope (VT) - the GRB\nposition will be refined and the study of the early phases of the GRB afterglow\nwill be possible. A set of three ground based dedicated instruments, two\nrobotic telescopes (GFTs) and a wide angle optical monitor (GWAC), will\ncomplement the space borne instruments. Thanks to the low energy trigger\nthreshold (~4 keV) of the ECLAIRs, SVOM is ideally suited for the detection of\nsoft, hence potentially most distant, GRBs. Its observing strategy is optimized\nto facilitate follow-up observations from the largest ground based facilities.",

        "title": "Multiline Zeeman Signatures Through Line Addition",
        "summary": "In order to get a significant Zeeman signature in the polarised spectra of a\nmagnetic star, we usually 'add' the contributions of numerous spectral lines;\nthe ultimate goal is to recover the spectropolarimetric prints of the magnetic\nfield in these line additions. Here we want to clarify the meaning of these\ntechniques of line addition; in particular, we try to interpret the meaning of\nthe 'pseudo-line' formed during this process and to find out why and how its\nZeeman signature is still meaningful. We create a synthetic case of line\naddition and apply well tested standard solar methods routinely used in the\nresearch on magnetism in our nearest star. The results are convincing and the\nZeeman signatures well detected; Solar methods are found to be quite efficient\nalso for stellar observations. We statistically compare line addition with\nleast-squares deconvolution and demonstrate that they both give very similar\nresults as a consequence of the special statistical properties of the weights.\nThe Zeeman signatures are unequivocally detected in this multiline approach. We\nmay anticipate the outcome that magnetic field detection is reliable well\nbeyond the weak-field approximation. Linear polarisation in the spectra of\nsolar type stars can be detected when the spectral resolution is sufficiently\nhigh.",

        "summary": "We develop the theory of a metamaterial composed of an array of discrete\nquantum absorbers inside a one-dimensional waveguide that implements a\nhigh-efficiency microwave photon detector. A basic design consists of a few\nmetastable superconducting nanocircuits spread inside and coupled to a\none-dimensional waveguide in a circuit QED setup. The arrival of a {\\it\npropagating} quantum microwave field induces an irreversible change in the\npopulation of the internal levels of the absorbers, due to a selective\nabsorption of photon excitations. This design is studied using a formal but\nsimple quantum field theory, which allows us to evaluate the single-photon\nabsorption efficiency for one and many absorber setups. As an example, we\nconsider a particular design that combines a coplanar coaxial waveguide with\nsuperconducting phase qubits, a natural but not exclusive playground for\nexperimental implementations. This work and a possible experimental realization\nmay stimulate the possible arrival of \"all-optical\" quantum information\nprocessing with propagating quantum microwaves, where a microwave photodetector\ncould play a key role.",

        "summary": "The formation of stars is a key process in astrophysics. Detailed knowledge\nof the physical mechanisms that govern stellar birth is a prerequisite for\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of our galactic home, the Milky Way.\nA theory of star formation is an essential part of any model for the origin of\nour solar system and of planets around other stars. Despite this pivotal\nimportance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of the\nprocesses that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.\n  Stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. Star\nformation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between the\ngravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magnetic\nfields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. The competition\nbetween these processes determines both the locations at which young stars form\nand how much mass they ultimately accrete. It plays out over many orders of\nmagnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. In\naddition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare and\nhard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and the\nresulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of a\nstar-forming cloud.\n  As a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control star\nformation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.\nThese can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they must\nbe used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations. Here we summarize\nthe state of modern star formation theory and review the recent advances in\nnumerical simulation techniques.",

Our\nmethod is based on the use of the empirical moments of the light curve that are\nintegral transforms evaluated from the observed light curves. The optical depth\nalong the line of sight and the limb darkening of the W-R star are modelled by\nsimple mathematical functions, and we derive analytical expressions for the\nmoments of the light curve as a function of the orbital parameters and the key\nparameters of the transparency and limb-darkening functions. These analytical\nexpressions are then inverted in order to derive the values of the orbital\ninclination, the stellar radii, the fractional luminosities, and the parameters\nof the wind transparency and limb-darkening laws. The method is applied to the\nSMC W-R eclipsing binary HD 5980, a remarkable object that underwent an\nLBV-like event in August 1994. The analysis refers to the pre-outburst\nobservational data. A synthetic light curve based on the elements derived for\nthe system allows a quality assessment of the results obtained.",

The physical model\nis based on a system of magneto-gasdynamical equations, including ohmic and\nambipolar diffusion, and a scheme for calculating the thermal and ionization\nstructure of a cloud. The dust and gas temperatures are determined during the\ncalculations of the thermal structure of the cloud. The results of computing\nthe dynamical and thermal structure of the cloud are used to model the\nradiative transfer in continuum and in molecular lines. We presented the\nresults for clouds in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. The evolution of a\nrotating magnetic protostellar cloud starting from a quasi-static state is also\nconsidered. Spectral maps for optically thick lines of linear molecules are\nanalyzed. We have shown that the influence of the magnetic field and rotation\ncan lead to a redistribution of angular momentum in the cloud and the formation\nof a characteristic rotational velocity structure. As a result, the\ndistribution of the velocity centroid of the molecular lines can acquire an\nhourglass shape. We plan to use the developed program package together with a\nmodel for the chemical evolution to interpret and model observed starless and\nprotostellar cores.",

        "summary": "We have used the Spitzer 22-um peakup array to observe thermal emission from\nthe nucleus and trail of comet 103P/Hartley 2, the target of NASA's Deep Impact\nExtended mission. The comet was observed on UT 2008 August 12 and 13, while the\ncomet was 5.5 AU from the Sun. We obtained two 200-frame sets of photometric\nimaging over a 2.7-hour period. To within the errors of the measurement, we\nfind no detection of any temporal variation between the two images. The comet\nshowed extended emission beyond a point source in the form of a faint trail\ndirected along the comet's anti-velocity vector. After modeling and removing\nthe trail emission, a NEATM model for the nuclear emission with beaming\nparameter of 0.95 +/- 0.20 indicates a small effective radius for the nucleus\nof 0.57 +/- 0.08 km and low geometric albedo 0.028 +/- 0.009 (1 sigma). With\nthis nucleus size and a water production rate of 3 x 10^28 molecules s-1 at\nperihelion (A'Hearn et al. 1995) we estimate that ~100% of the surface area is\nactively emitting volatile material at perihelion. Reports of emission activity\nout to ~5 AU (Lowry et al. 2001, Snodgrass et al. 2008) support our finding of\na highly active nuclear surface. Compared to Deep Impact's first target, comet\n9P/Tempel 1, Hartley 2's nucleus is one-fifth as wide (and about one-hundredth\nthe mass) while producing a similar amount of outgassing at perihelion with\nabout 13 times the active surface fraction. Unlike Tempel 1, it should be\nhighly susceptible to jet driven spin-up torques, and so could be rotating at a\nmuch higher frequency. Barring a catastrophic breakup or major fragmentation\nevent, the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions (~700\nyrs) at its current rate of mass loss.",

        "summary": "In small-scale experiments such as CODALEMA and LOPES, radio detection of\ncosmic rays has demonstrated its potential as a technique for cosmic ray\nmeasurements up to the highest energies. Radio detection promises measurements\nwith high duty-cycle, allows a direction reconstruction with very good angular\nresolution, and provides complementary information on energy and nature of the\ncosmic ray primaries with respect to particle detectors at ground and\nfluorescence telescopes. Within the Pierre Auger Observatory, we tackle the\ntechnological and scientific challenges for an application of the radio\ndetection technique on large scales. Here, we report on the results obtained so\nfar using the Southern Auger site and the plans for an engineering array of\nradio detectors covering an area of ~20 km^2.",

        "summary": "Traditionally, the mass / velocity anisotropy degeneracy (MAD) inherent in\nthe spherical, stationary, non-streaming Jeans equation has been handled by\nassuming a mass profile and fitting models to the observed kinematical data.\nHere, the opposite approach is considered: the equation of anisotropic\nkinematic projection is inverted for known arbitrary anisotropy to yield the\nspace radial velocity dispersion profile in terms of an integral involving the\nradial profiles of anisotropy and isotropic dynamical pressure. Then, through\nthe Jeans equation, the mass profile is derived in terms of double integrals of\nobservable quantities. Single integral formulas for both deprojection and mass\ninversion are provided for several simple anisotropy models (isotropic, radial,\ncircular, general constant, Osipkov-Merritt, Mamon-Lokas and\nDiemand-Moore-Stadel). Tests of the mass inversion on NFW models with these\nanisotropy models yield accurate results in the case of perfect observational\ndata, and typically better than 70% (in 4 cases out of 5) accurate mass\nprofiles for the sampling errors expected from current observational data on\nclusters of galaxies. For the NFW model with mildly increasing radial\nanisotropy, the mass is found to be insensitive to the adopted anisotropy\nprofile at 7 scale radii and to the adopted anisotropy radius at 3 scale radii.\nThis anisotropic mass inversion method is a useful complementary tool to\nanalyze the mass and anisotropy profiles of spherical systems. It provides the\npractical means to lift the MAD in quasi-spherical systems such as globular\nclusters, round dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies, as well as groups and\nclusters of galaxies, when the anisotropy of the tracer is expected to be\nlinearly related to the slope of its density.",

        "summary": "Faraday rotation (FR) is widely used to infer the orientation and strength of\nmagnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas. Although the absence of\nelectron-positron pairs is a plausible assumption in many astrophysical\nenvironments, the magnetospheres of pulsars and black holes and their\nassociated jets may involve a significant pair plasma fraction. This motivates\nbeing mindful of the effect of positrons on FR. Here we derive and interpret\nexact expressions of FR for a neutral plasma of arbitrary composition. We focus\non electron-ion-positron plasmas in which charge neutrality is maintained by an\narbitrary combination of ions and positrons. Because a pure electron-positron\nplasma has zero FR, the greater the fraction of positrons the higher the field\nstrength required to account for the same FR. We first obtain general formulae\nand then specifically consider parameters relevant to active galctic nuclei\n(AGN) jets to illustrate the significant differences in field strengths that FR\nmeasurements from radio frequency measurements. Complementarily, using galaxy\ncluster core plasmas as examples, we discuss how plasma composition can be\nconstrained if independent measurements of the field strength and number\ndensity are available and combined with FR.",

        "summary": "Besides new observations, mining old photographic plates and CCD image\narchives represents an opportunity to recover and secure newly discovered\nasteroids, also to improve the orbits of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs),\nPotentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) and Virtual Impactors (VIs). These are\nthe main research aims of the EURONEAR network. As stated by the IAU, the vast\ncollection of image archives stored worldwide is still insufficiently explored,\nand could be mined for known NEAs and other asteroids appearing occasionally in\ntheir fields. This data mining could be eased using a server to search and\nclassify findings based on the asteroid class and the discovery date as\n\"precoveries\" or \"recoveries\". We built PRECOVERY, a public facility which uses\nthe Virtual Observatory SkyBoT webservice of IMCCE to search for all known\nSolar System objects in a given observation. To datamine an entire archive,\nPRECOVERY requires the observing log in a standard format and outputs a\ndatabase listing the sorted encounters of NEAs, PHAs, numbered and un-numbered\nasteroids classified as precoveries or recoveries based on the daily updated\nIAUMPC database. As a first application, we considered an archive including\nabout 13,000 photographic plates exposed between 1930 and 2005 at the\nAstronomical Observatory in Bucharest, Romania. PRECOVERY can be applied to\nother archives, being intended as a public facility offered to the community by\nthe EURONEAR project. This is the first of a series of papers aimed to improve\norbits of PHAs and NEAs using precovered data derived from archives of images\nto be data mined in collaboration with students and amateurs. In the next paper\nwe will search the CFHT Legacy Survey, while data mining of other archives is\nplanned for the near future.",

        "title": "Limitations for shapelet-based weak-lensing measurements",
        "summary": "We seek to understand the impact on shape estimators obtained from circular\nand elliptical shapelet models under two realistic conditions: (a) only a\nlimited number of shapelet modes is available for the model, and (b) the\nintrinsic galactic shapes are not restricted to shapelet models.\n  We create a set of simplistic simulations, in which the galactic shapes\nfollow a Sersic profile. By varying the Sersic index and applied shear, we\nquantify the amount of bias on shear estimates which arises from insufficient\nmodeling. Additional complications due to PSF convolution, pixelation and pixel\nnoise are also discussed.\n  Steep and highly elliptical galaxy shapes cannot be accurately modeled within\nthe circular shapelet basis system and are biased towards shallower and less\nelongated shapes. This problem can be cured partially by allowing elliptical\nbasis functions, but for steep profiles elliptical shapelet models still depend\ncritically on accurate ellipticity priors. As a result, shear estimates are\ntypically biased low. Independently of the particular form of the estimator,\nthe bias depends on the true intrinsic galaxy morphology, but also on the size\nand shape of the PSF.\n  As long as the issues discussed here are not solved, the shapelet method\ncannot provide weak-lensing measurements with an accuracy demanded by upcoming\nmissions and surveys, unless one can provide an accurate and reliable\ncalibration, specific for the dataset under investigation.",

        "summary": "Focusing mirrors for X-ray telescopes in grazing incidence, introduced in the\n70s, are characterized in terms of their performance by their imaging quality\nand effective area, which in turn determines their sensitivity. Even though the\non-axis effective area is assumed in general to characterize the collecting\npower of an X-ray optic, the telescope capability of imaging extended X-ray\nsources is also determined by the variation in its effective area with the\noff-axis angle. [...] The complex task of designing optics for future X-ray\ntelescopes entails detailed computations of both imaging quality and effective\narea on- and off-axis. Because of their apparent complexity, both aspects have\nbeen, so far, treated by using ray-tracing routines aimed at simulating the\ninteraction of X-ray photons with the reflecting surfaces of a given focusing\nsystem. Although this approach has been widely exploited and proven to be\neffective, it would also be attractive to regard the same problem from an\nanalytical viewpoint, to assess an optical design of an X-ray optical module\nwith a simpler calculation than a ray-tracing routine. [...] We have developed\nuseful analytical formulae for the off-axis effective area of a\ndouble-reflection mirror in the double cone approximation, requiring only an\nintegration and the standard routines to calculate the X-ray coating\nreflectivity for a given incidence angle. [...] Algebraic expressions are\nprovided for the mirror geometric area, as a function of the off-axis angle.\nFinally, the results of the analytical computations presented here are\nvalidated by comparison with the corresponding predictions of a ray-tracing\ncode.",

We have studied the impact of atmospheric variations on extensive air\nshowers by means of the surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The\nrate of events shows a ~10% seasonal modulation and ~2% diurnal one. We find\nthat the observed behaviour is explained by a model including the effects\nassociated with the variations of pressure and density. The former affects the\nlongitudinal development of air showers while the latter influences the Moliere\nradius and hence the lateral distribution of the shower particles. The model is\nvalidated with full simulations of extensive air showers using atmospheric\nprofiles measured at the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory.",

        "summary": "We recently reported on the detection of a possible planetary-mass companion\nto Beta Pictoris at a projected separation of 8 AU from the star, using data\ntaken in November 2003 with NaCo, the adaptive-optics system installed on the\nVery Large Telescope UT4. Eventhough no second epoch detection was available,\nthere are strong arguments to favor a gravitationally bound companion rather\nthan a background object. If confirmed and located at a physical separation of\n8 AU, this young, hot (~1500 K), massive Jovian companion (~8 Mjup) would be\nthe closest planet to its star ever imaged, could be formed via core-accretion,\nand could explain the main morphological and dynamical properties of the dust\ndisk. Our goal was to return to Beta Pic five years later to obtain a\nsecond-epoch observation of the companion or, in case of a non-detection,\nconstrain its orbit. Deep adaptive-optics L'-band direct images of Beta Pic and\nKs-band Four-Quadrant-Phase-Mask (4QPM) coronagraphic images were recorded with\nNaCo in January and February 2009. We also use 4QPM data taken in November\n2004. No point-like signal with the brightness of the companion candidate\n(apparent magnitudes L'=11.2 or Ks ~ 12.5) is detected at projected distances\ndown to 6.5 AU from the star in the 2009 data. As expected, the non-detection\ndoes not allow to rule out a background object; however, we show that it is\nconsistent with the orbital motion of a bound companion that got closer to the\nstar since first observed in 2003 and that is just emerging from behind the\nstar at the present epoch. We place strong constraints on the possible orbits\nof the companion and discuss future observing prospects.",

The transient\nsurvey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the\n48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves\nfor detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60-inch\ntelescope. PTF uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-m\ntelescope time. With an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth of\napproximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in R (5 sigma, median seeing). Four major\nexperiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernova\nsearch; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day;\n3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and 4) a\n3-pi sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, realtime transient\nclassification and follow up, as well as a database including every source\ndetected in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including\nseveral months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, the\nobserving plans and the data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the\nfirst 51 PTF optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.",

        "summary": "Gravitational lensing allows us to probe the structure of matter on a broad\nrange of astronomical scales, and as light from a distant source traverses an\nintervening galaxy, compact matter such as planets, stars, and black holes act\nas individual lenses. The magnification from such microlensing results in rapid\nbrightness fluctuations which reveal not only the properties of the lensing\nmasses, but also the surface brightness distribution in the source. However,\nwhile the combination of deflections due to individual stars is linear, the\nresulting magnifications are highly non-linear, leading to significant\ncomputational challenges which currently limit the range of problems which can\nbe tackled. This paper presents a new and novel implementation of a numerical\napproach to gravitational microlensing, increasing the scale of the problems\nthat can be tackled by more than two orders of magnitude, opening up a new\nregime of astrophysically interesting problems.",

        "summary": "Pulsars are among the prime targets for the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard\nthe recently launched Fermi observatory. The LAT will study the gamma-ray\nUniverse between 20 MeV and 300 GeV with unprecedented detail. Increasing\nnumbers of gamma-ray pulsars are being firmly identified, yet their emission\nmechanisms are far from being understood. To better investigate and exploit the\nLAT capabilities for pulsar science, a set of new detailed pulsar simulation\ntools have been developed within the LAT collaboration. The structure of the\npulsar simulator package PulsarSpectrum is presented here. Starting from photon\ndistributions in energy and phase obtained from theoretical calculations or\nphenomenological considerations, gamma rays are generated and their arrival\ntimes at the spacecraft are determined by taking into account effects such as\nbarycentric effects and timing noise. Pulsars in binary systems also can be\nsimulated given orbital parameters. We present how simulations can be used for\ngenerating a realistic set of gamma rays as observed by the LAT, focusing on\nsome case studies that show the performance of the LAT for pulsar observations.",

        "title": "Determination of the stellar (n,gamma) cross section of 40Ca with\n  accelerator mass spectrometry",
        "summary": "The stellar (n,gamma) cross section of 40Ca at kT=25 keV has been measured\nwith a combination of the activation technique and accelerator mass\nspectrometry (AMS). This combination is required when direct off-line counting\nof the produced activity is compromised by the long half-life and/or missing\ngamma-ray transitions. The neutron activations were performed at the Karlsruhe\nVan de Graaff accelerator using the quasistellar neutron spectrum of kT=25 keV\nproduced by the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction. The subsequent AMS measurements were\ncarried out at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) with a 3 MV\ntandem accelerator. The doubly magic 40Ca is a bottle-neck isotope in\nincomplete silicon burning, and its neutron capture cross section determines\nthe amount of leakage, thus impacting on the eventual production of iron group\nelements. Because of its high abundance, 40Ca can also play a secondary role as\n\"neutron poison\" for the s-process. Previous determinations of this value at\nstellar energies were based on time-of-flight measurements. Our method uses an\nindependent approach, and yields for the Maxwellian-averaged cross section at\nkT=30 keV a value of <sigma>30 keV= 5.73+/-0.34 mb.",

        "title": "Solving the stellar 62Ni problem with AMS",
        "summary": "An accurate knowledge of the neutron capture cross sections of 62,63Ni is\ncrucial since both isotopes take key positions which affect the whole reaction\nflow in the weak s process up to A=90. No experimental value for the\n63Ni(n,gamma) cross section exists so far, and until recently the experimental\nvalues for 62Ni(n,gamma) at stellar temperatures (kT=30 keV) ranged between 12\nand 37 mb. This latter discrepancy could now be solved by two activations with\nfollowing AMS using the GAMS setup at the Munich tandem accelerator which are\nalso in perfect agreement with a recent time-of-flight measurement. The\nresulting (preliminary) Maxwellian cross section at kT=30 keV was determined to\nbe <sigma>30keV = 23.4 +/- 4.6 mb. Additionally, we have measured the\n64Ni(gamma,n)63Ni cross section close to threshold. Photoactivations at 13.5\nMeV, 11.4 MeV and 10.3 MeV were carried out with the ELBE accelerator at\nForschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. A first AMS measurement of the sample\nactivated at 13.5 MeV revealed a cross section smaller by more than a factor of\n2 compared to NON-SMOKER predictions.",

        "title": "Experimental and theoretical study of diffraction properties of various\n  crystals for the realization of a soft gamma-ray Laue lens",
        "summary": "Crystals are the elementary constituents of Laue lenses, an emerging\ntechnology which could allow the realization of a space borne telescope 10 to\n100 times more sensitive than existing ones in the 100 keV - 1.5 MeV energy\nrange. This study addresses the current endeavor to the development of\nefficient crystals for the realization of a Laue lens.\n  In the theoretical part 35 candidate-crystals both pure and two-components\nare considered. Their peak reflectivity at 100 keV, 500 keV and 1 MeV is\ncalculated assuming they are mosaic crystals. It results that a careful\nselection of crystals can allow a reflectivity above 30% over the whole energy\nrange, and even reaching 40% in its lower part. Experimentally, we concentrated\non three different materials (Si_{1-x}Ge_x with gradient of composition, mosaic\nCu and Au) that have been measured both at ESRF and ILL using\nhighly-monochromatic beams ranging from 300 keV up to 816 keV. The aim was to\ncheck their homogeneity, quality and angular spread (mosaicity). These crystals\nhave shown outstanding performance such as reflectivity up to 31% at ~600 keV\n(Au) or 60% at 300 keV (SiGe) and angular spread as low as 15 arcsec for Cu,\nfulfilling very well the requirements for a Laue lens application.\nUnexpectedly, we also noticed important discrepancies with Darwin's model when\na crystal is measured using various energies.",

        "title": "Automated Determination of [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] from Low-Resolution\n  Spectroscopy",
        "summary": "We develop an automated spectral synthesis technique for the estimation of\nmetallicities ([Fe/H]) and carbon abundances ([C/Fe]) for metal-poor stars,\nincluding carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, for which other methods may prove\ninsufficient. This technique, autoMOOG, is designed to operate on relatively\nstrong features visible in even low- to medium-resolution spectra, yielding\nresults comparable to much more telescope-intensive high-resolution studies. We\nvalidate this method by comparison with 913 stars which have existing\nhigh-resolution and low- to medium-resolution to medium-resolution spectra, and\nthat cover a wide range of stellar parameters. We find that at low\nmetallicities ([Fe/H] < -2.0), we successfully recover both the metallicity and\ncarbon abundance, where possible, with an accuracy of ~ 0.20 dex. At higher\nmetallicities, due to issues of continuum placement in spectral normalization\ndone prior to the running of autoMOOG, a general underestimate of the overall\nmetallicity of a star is seen, although the carbon abundance is still\nsuccessfully recovered. As a result, this method is only recommended for use on\nsamples of stars of known sufficiently low metallicity. For these\nlow-metallicity stars, however, autoMOOG performs much more consistently and\nquickly than similar, existing techniques, which should allow for analyses of\nlarge samples of metal-poor stars in the near future. Steps to improve and\ncorrect the continuum placement difficulties are being pursued.",

The detection\nprinciple relies on the observation, using photomultipliers, of the Cherenkov\nlight emitted by charged leptons induced by neutrino interactions in the\nsurrounding detector medium. In the Northern hemisphere, while the pioneering\nBaikal telescope, has been operating for 10 years, most of the activity now\nconcentrates in the Mediterranean sea. Recently, the Antares collaboration has\ncompleted the construction of a 12 line array comprising ~ 900\nphotomultipliers.

In\norder to minimize the ambiguities in the identification of WIMPs' interactions\nin their search, in more experiments, two distinct quantities are\nsimultaneously measured: the ionization and phonon or light from scintillation\nsignals. Silicon and germanium crystals are used in some experiments. In this\npaper we discuss the production of defects in semiconductors due to WIMP\ninteractions and estimate their contribution in the energy balance. This\nphenomenon is present at all temperatures, is important in the range of keV\nenergies, but is not taken into consideration in the usual analysis of\nexperimental signals and could introduce errors in identification for WIMPs.",

        "summary": "In this contribution we describe the hardware, firmware and software\ncomponents of the readout system of the MAGIC-II Cherenkov telescope on the\nCanary island La Palma. The PMT analog signals are transmitted by means of\noptical fibers from the MAGIC-II camera to the 80 m away counting house where\nthey are routed to the new high bandwidth and fully programmable receiver\nboards (MONSTER), which convert back the signals from optical to electrical\nones. Then the signals are split, one half provide the input signals for the\nlevel ONE trigger system while the other half is sent to the digitizing units.\nThe fast Cherenkov pulses are sampled by low-power Domino Ring Sampler chips\n(DRS2) and temporarily stored in an array of 1024 capacitors. Signals are\nsampled at the ultra-fast speed of 2 GSample/s, which allows a very precise\nmeasurement of the signal arrival times in all pixels. They are then digitized\nwith 12-bit resolution by an external ADC readout at 40 MHz speed. The Domino\nsamplers are integrated in the newly designed mezzanines which equip a set of\nfourteen multi-purpose PULSAR boards. Finally, the data are sent through an\nS-LINK optical interface to a single computer. The entire DAQ hardware is\ncontrolled through a VME interface and steered by the slow control software\nprogram (MIR). The Data AcQuisition software program (DAQ) proceeds finally to\nthe event building and data storage.",

        "summary": "The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is currently observing the cosmic\nmicrowave background with arcminute resolution at 148 GHz, 218 GHz, and 277\nGHz. In this paper, we present ACT's first results. Data have been analyzed\nusing a maximum-likelihood map-making method which uses B-splines to model and\nremove the atmospheric signal. It has been used to make high-precision beam\nmaps from which we determine the experiment's window functions. This beam\ninformation directly impacts all subsequent analyses of the data. We also used\nthe method to map a sample of galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect, and show five clusters previously detected with X-ray or SZ\nobservations. We provide integrated Compton-y measurements for each cluster. Of\nparticular interest is our detection of the z = 0.44 component of A3128 and our\ncurrent non-detection of the low-redshift part, providing strong evidence that\nthe further cluster is more massive as suggested by X-ray measurements. This is\na compelling example of the redshift-independent mass selection of the SZ\neffect.",

It currently addresses\nenergies up to 100 TeV, including elemental spectra, secondary/primary nuclei\nratios, antiprotons, electrons and positrons. It is updated regularly as data\nappears in the literature. It is supported by access software. The community is\nencouraged to participate by providing data, pointing out errors or omissions,\nand suggestions for improvements.",

        "summary": "Context: The F8 star HD 181906 (effective temperature ~6300K) was observed\nfor 156 days by the CoRoT satellite during the first long run in the centre\ndirection. Analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acoustic\noscillations. However, the faintness of the target (m_v=7.65) means the\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low S/N\nleads to complications in the analysis. Aims: To extract global variables of\nthe star as well as key parameters of the p modes observed in the power\nspectrum of the lightcurve. Methods: The power spectrum of the lightcurve, a\nwavelet transform and spot fitting have been used to obtain the average\nrotation rate of the star and its inclination angle. Then, the autocorrelation\nof the power spectrum and the power spectrum of the power spectrum were used to\nproperly determine the large separation. Finally, estimations of the mode\nparameters have been done by maximizing the likelihood of a global fit, where\nseveral modes were fit simultaneously. Results: We have been able to infer the\nmean surface rotation rate of the star (~4 microHz) with indications of the\npresence of surface differential rotation, the large separation of the p modes\n(~87 microHz), and therefore also the ridges corresponding to overtones of the\nacoustic modes.",

        "title": "Post-launch performance of the Fermi Large Area Telescope",
        "summary": "The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\nstarted nominal operations on August 13, 2008, after about 60 days of\ninstrument checkout and commissioning and is currently performing an all-sky\ngamma-ray survey from 30 MeV to above 300 GeV with unprecedented sensitivity\nand angular resolution. The LAT pre-launch response was tuned using Monte Carlo\nsimulations and test beam data from a campaign necessarily limited in scope.\nThis suggested a conservative approach in dealing with systematics that affect\nthe reconstruction analysis of the first months of data taking. The first major\nupdate of the instrument performance based on flight data is now being\ncompleted. Not only are the LAT calibrations now based on flight data, but also\nthe ground event reconstruction has been updated to accommodate on-orbit\ncalibrations, and response was carefully verified using real data from\ncelestial sources. In this contribution we describe the current best knowledge\nof the instrument, and our plans towards releasing public response functions to\nsupport data release in year 2.",

        "summary": "The Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument on board the Fermi satellite\nconsists of a multi-layer silicon-strip tracker interleaved with tungsten\nconverters (TKR), followed by a CsI crystal hodoscopic calorimeter (CAL).\nSixteen TKR and CAL modules are assembled in a 4$\\times$4 array. A segmented\nanticoincidence plastic scintillator (ACD) surrounds the TKRs. The primary\ncosmic-ray electron/positron energy spectrum has been measured from 20 GeV to 1\nTeV using a dedicated event analysis that ensures efficient electron detection\nand reduced hadron contamination. Results from detailed Monte Carlo simulations\nhave been used to reconstruct the observed energy spectrum to the primary\ncosmic ray spectrum. We present here details of the analysis procedure and the\nenergy spectrum reconstruction.",

The\nHPD camera with high quantum efficiency will increase the MAGIC-II sensitivity\nand lower the energy threshold. The basic performance of the HPDs has been\nmeasured and a prototype of an HPD cluster has been developed to be mounted on\nMAGIC-II.

In this context, the visibilities measured\nessentially identify with a noisy and incomplete Fourier coverage of the\nproduct of the planar signals with a linear chirp modulation. In light of the\nrecent theory of compressed sensing and in the perspective of defining the best\npossible imaging techniques for sparse signals, we analyze the related spread\nspectrum phenomenon and suggest its universality relative to the sparsity\ndictionary.

The control system for\nboth telescopes is assigned to a number of autonomous functional units called\nsubsystems. The control hardware and software components of the second\ntelescope subsystems have been modified with respect to their counterparts of\nthe first telescope. A new Central Control (CC) program has been developed to\ncommunicate with all the subsystems of both telescopes and to coordinate their\nfunctionality thus easing the stereo data taking procedure. We describe the\nwhole control system in detail: all the subsystems and their communication with\nthe Central Control, the CC graphic user interface that grants operators the\nfull control over the two telescopes, and the automatic checking procedures,\nwhich guarantee the safety and 'health' of the apparatus.",

The initially achieved low trigger\nthreshold of 60 GeV has been further reduced by means of a novel trigger that\nallows the telescope to record gamma ray showers down to 25 GeV. The high\ntrigger rate combined with the 2 GHz signal sampling rate results in large data\nvolumes that can reach 1 TByte per night for MAGIC-I and even more with the\nsecond MAGIC telescope coming soon into operation. To deal with the large\nstorage requirements of MAGIC-I and MAGIC-II, we have installed the distributed\nfile system GFS and a cluster of computers with concurrent access to the same\nshared storage units. The system can not only handle a sustained DAQ write rate\nabove 1.2 kHz for MAGIC-I, but also allows other nodes to perform simultaneous\nconcurrent access to the data on the shared storage units. Various simultaneous\ntasks can be used at any time, in parallel with data taking, including data\ncompression, taping, on-line analysis, calibration and analysis of the data.\nThe system is designed to quickly recover after the failure of one node in the\ncluster and to be easily extended as more nodes or storage units are required\nin the future.",

In particular, the thermo-refractive noise in the\nGEO600 beamsplitter is expected to make a substantial contribution to the\ninterferometer's total noise budget. Here we present a new computation of the\nGEO600 thermo-refractive noise which takes into account the beam's elliptical\nprofile and, more importantly, the fact that the laser beam induces a standing\nelectromagnetic wave in the beamsplitter. The use of updated parameters results\nin the overall reduction of the calculated noise amplitude by a factor of about\n5 in the low-frequency part of the GEO600 band, compared to the previous\nestimates. We also find, by contrast with previous calculations, that\nthermo-refractive fluctuations result in white noise between 600 Hz and 39 MHz,\nat a level of $8.5\\cdot 10^{-24}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Finally, we describe a new type\nof thermal noise, which we call the thermo-chemical noise. This is caused by a\nrandom motion of optically-active chemical impurities or structural defects in\nthe direction along a steep intensity gradient of the standing wave. We discuss\nthe potential relevance of the thermo-chemical noise for GEO600.",

        "summary": "Recent measurements of the cosmic-ray electron (e-) and positron (e+) fluxes\nshow apparent excesses compared to the spectra expected by standard cosmic-ray\n(CR) propagation models in our galaxy. These excesses may be related to\nparticle acceleration in local astrophysical objects, or to dark matter\nannihilation/decay. The e+/e- ratio (measured up to ~100 GeV) increases\nunexpectedly above 10 GeV and this may be connected to the excess measured in\nall-electron flux at 300-800 GeV. Measurement of this ratio at higher energies\nis a key parameter to understand the origin of these spectral anomalies.\nImaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) detect electromagnetic air\nshowers above 100 GeV, but, with this technique, the discrimination between\nprimary e-, e+ and diffuse gamma-rays is almost impossible. However, the Moon\nand the geomagnetic field provide an incredible opportunity to separate these 3\ncomponents. Indeed, the Moon produces a 0.5deg-diameter hole in the isotropic\nCR flux, which is shifted by the Earth magnetosphere depending on the momentum\nand charge of the particles. Below few TeV, the e+ and e- shadows are shifted\nat >0.5deg each side of the Moon and the e+, e- and gamma-ray shadows are\nspatially separated. IACT can observe the e+ and e- shadows without direct\nmoonlight in the field of view, but the scattered moonlight induces a very high\nbackground level. Operating at the highest altitude (2200m), with the largest\ntelescopes (17m) of the current IACT, MAGIC is the best candidate to reach a\nlow energy threshold in these peculiar conditions. Here we discuss the\nfeasibility of such observations.",

Such a survey will make it possible to address a number of\nfundamental problems: search for dark energy via the discovery and photometry\nof supernovas (including SNIa), search for exoplanets, microlensing effects,\ndiscovery of minor bodies in the Solar System and space-junk monitoring. All\nMASTER telescopes can be guided by alerts, and we plan to observe prompt\noptical emission from gamma-ray bursts synchronously in several filters and in\nseveral polarization planes.",

The maps were made in the two\nfields originally targeted at 0.85mm with SCUBA in the SHADES project, namely\nthe Lockman Hole East (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mJy rms) and the Subaru XMM\nDeep Field (1.0-1.7 mJy rms). The wealth of existing and forthcoming deep\nmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm source\npopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequent\npapers. Here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114\nhigh-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statistical\nanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm source\nnumber counts. Through careful comparison, we find that both the COSMOS and\nGOODS North fields, also imaged with AzTEC, contain an excess of mm sources\nover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. In particular, our\nnew AzTEC/SHADES results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dust\nenshrouded starbursts (S_{1.1} > 3 mJy) are 25-50% less common than would have\nbeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential roles\nof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. We compare number count\npredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population to\nthese SMG surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoing\nrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, and\nfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetre\ngalaxies found in this survey.",

        "summary": "Colliding flows are a commonly used scenario for the formation of molecular\nclouds in numerical simulations. Due to the thermal instability of the warm\nneutral medium, turbulence is produced by cooling. We carry out a\ntwo-dimensional numerical study of such colliding flows in order to test\nwhether statistical properties inferred from adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)\nsimulations are robust with respect to the applied refinement criteria. We\ncompare probability density functions of various quantities as well as the\nclump statistics and fractal dimension of the density fields in AMR simulations\nto a static-grid simulation. The static grid with 2048^2 cells matches the\nresolution of the most refined subgrids in the AMR simulations. The density\nstatistics is reproduced fairly well by AMR. Refinement criteria based on the\ncooling time or the turbulence intensity appear to be superior to the standard\ntechnique of refinement by overdensity. Nevertheless, substantial differences\nin the flow structure become apparent. In general, it is difficult to separate\nnumerical effects from genuine physical processes in AMR simulations.",

        "summary": "The Space multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) is a proposed Chinese\nastronomical satellite, dedicated to the detection, localization and\nmeasurement of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the cosmological scale. An\nefficient algorithm is developed for the purpose of onboard star extraction\nfrom the CCD images obtained with the Visible Telescope (VT) on board SVOM. The\nCCD pixel coordinates of the reference stars will be used to refine the\nastronomical position of the satellite, which will facilitate trigger rapid\nground-based follow-up obsevations of the GRBs. In this algorithm, the image is\ndivided into a number of grid cells and the \"global\" pixel-value maximum within\neach cell is taken as the first-guess position of a \"bright\" star. The correct\ncenter postion of a star is then computed using a simple iterative method.\nApplying two additional strategies, i.e., scanning the image only by even (or\nodd) lines or in a black-white chess board mode, are proposed to further reduce\nthe time to extract the stars. To examine the efficiency of the above\naglorithms, we applied them to the experimental images obtained with a\nground-based telescope. We find that the accuracy of the astronomical\npositioning achieved by our method is comparable to that derived by using the\nconventional star-extraction method, while the former needs CPU time about 25\ntimes less than the latter. This will significantly improve the performance of\nthe SVOM VT mission.",

        "summary": "The galaxy NGC 6946 contains a gas-star complex of 700 pc in diameter which\nappears populated by tens of young stellar clusters, and a Super Star Cluster\n(SSC) as massive as 10$^6$ M$\\odot$. The ionized gas, as drawn by the H$\\alpha$\nemission, delineates an almost circular shape which we show here to be in\nexpansion. Previous studies have analyzed the stellar component of the complex,\nas well as the structure of the atomic and ionized gas; these analyses were\nrestricted to the blueshifted component along the whole extent of the bubble or\nto a smaller inner region where both sides of an expanding bubble were seen. In\nthis work we present a complete spectroscopic study of this object for two\nposition angles crossing each other close to the young massive SSC. We have\nobtained new data with a spectral resolution six times better than previous\nspectroscopic studies, taken under atmospheric conditions better than those\npreviously reported, allowing us to detect the approaching and receding walls\nof one the largest bubbles in external galaxies ever studied in detail.\n  The kinematical analysis shows a large expanding bubble, whose walls appear\nto be highly structured with superposed smaller shells, likely originated as\nthe result of star forming events occurring at the edges of the larger scale\nshell, a la Huygens. We also study some diagnostic diagrams of the ionized gas\nand conclude that most of the observed ionization is originated by photons from\nhot stars, but with clear evidence that some of the gas is shock ionized.\n  This peculiar complex is an excellent laboratory for the analysis of the\ninteraction and feedback between the gas where the stars were formed and the\nyoung and massive generation of new born stars.",

We\nquantitatively characterize and provide visualizations of the dependence of\nthis probability as a function of orbital period upon several observing\nstrategy and astrophysical parameters, such as length of observing run,\nobserving cadence, length of night, transit duration and depth, and the minimum\nnumber of sampled transits. The ability to detect a transit is directly related\nto the intrinsic noise of the observations. In our simulations of observational\nwindow functions, we explicitly address non-correlated (gaussian or white)\nnoise and correlated (red) noise and discuss how these two noise components\naffect transit detectability in fundamentally different manners, especially for\nlong periods and/or small transit depths. We furthermore discuss the\nconsequence of competing effects on transit detectability, elaborate on\nmeasures of observing strategies, and examine the projected efficiency of\ndifferent transit survey scenarios with respect to certain regions of parameter\nspace.",

The large teaching effort on what is\ninterferometry and for what purpose it can be used, together with weak, but\nalready convincing imaging capabilities, make the technique reaching a ?mature?\nstate.

We also investigate\natmospheres with isotropic scattering and forward scattering aerosol particles,\nas well as models with two scattering layers.\n  The model grid provides a tool for extracting quantitative results from\npolarimetric measurements of planetary atmospheres from solar system planets\nand extrasolar planets, in particular on the scattering properties and\nstratification of particles in the highest atmosphere layers.\nSpectropolarimetry of solar system planets offers complementary information to\nspectroscopy and polarization flux colors can be used for a first\ncharacterization of exoplanet atmospheres.

We developed\nautomated data analysis tools that include algorithms for jump correction,\nlight-curve detrending, frequency detection, frequency combination search, and\nfor frequency and period spacing searches. Besides numerous new, classical,\nslowly pulsating B stars, we find evidence for a new class of low-amplitude\nB-type pulsators between the SPB and Delta Sct instability strips, with a very\nbroad range of frequencies and low amplitudes, as well as several slowly\npulsating B stars with residual excess power at frequencies typically a factor\nthree above their expected g-mode frequencies. The frequency data we obtained\nfor numerous new B-type pulsators represent an appropriate starting point for\nfurther theoretical analyses of these stars, once their effective temperature,\ngravity, rotation velocity, and abundances will be derived spectroscopically in\nthe framework of an ongoing FLAMES survey at the VLT.",

We approach this problem with an adaptive and\nfully automatic Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, able to\nsample from the joint posterior density function (as established by Bayes\ntheorem) for a given mixture of signals \"out of the box'', handling the total\nnumber of signals as an additional unknown parameter beside the unknown\nparameters of each individual source and the noise floor. We show in examples\nfrom the LISA Mock Data Challenge implementing the full response of LISA in its\nTDI description that this sampler is able to extract monochromatic Double White\nDwarf signals out of colored instrumental noise and additional foreground and\nbackground noise successfully in a global fitting approach. We introduce 2\nexamples with fixed number of signals (MCMC sampling), and 1 example with\nunknown number of signals (RJ-MCMC), the latter further promoting the idea\nbehind an experimental adaptation of the model indicator proposal densities in\nthe main sampling stage. We note that the experienced runtimes and degeneracies\nin parameter extraction limit the shown examples to the extraction of a low but\nrealistic number of signals.",

        "summary": "We fit the colour-magnitude diagrams of stars between the zero-age\nmain-sequence and terminal-age main sequence in young clusters and\nassociations. The ages we derive are a factor 1.5 to 2 longer than the commonly\nused ages for these regions, which are derived from the positions of\npre-main-sequence stars in colour-magnitude diagrams. From an examination of\nthe uncertainties in the main-sequence and pre-main-sequence models, we\nconclude that the longer age scale is probably the correct one, which implies\nwe must revise upwards the commonly used ages for young clusters and\nassociations. Such a revision would explain the discrepancy between the\nobservational lifetimes of proto-planetary discs and theoretical calculations\nof the time to form planets. It would also explain the absence of clusters with\nages between 5 and 30Myr.\n  We use the $\\tau^2$ statistic to fit the main-sequence data, but find that we\nmust make significant modifications if we are to fit sequences which have\nvertical segments in the colour-magnitude diagram. We present this modification\nalong with improvements to methods of calculating the goodness-of-fit statistic\nand parameter uncertainties.\n  Software implementing the methods described in this paper is available from\nhttp://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/tau-squared/",

        "summary": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps published by the\nWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) team are found to be inconsistent\nwith the differential time-ordered data (TOD), from which the maps are\nreconstructed. The inconsistency indicates that there is a serious problem in\nthe map making routine of the WMAP team, and it is necessary to reprocess the\nWMAP data. We develop a self-consistent software package of map-making and\npower spectrum estimation independently of the WMAP team. Our software passes a\nvariety of tests. New CMB maps are then reconstructed, which are significantly\ndifferent from the official WMAP maps. In the new maps, the inconsistency\ndisappeared, along with the hitherto unexplained high level alignment between\nthe CMB quadrupole and octopole components detected in released WMAP maps. An\nimproved CMB cross-power spectrum is then derived from the new maps which\nbetter agrees with that of BOOMRANG. Two important results are hence obtained:\nthe CMB quadrupole drops to nearly zero, and the power in multiple moment range\nbetween 200 and 675 decreases on average by about 13%, causing the best-fit\ncosmological parameters to change considerably, e.g., the total matter density\nincreases from 0.26 up to 0.32 and the dark energy density decreases from 0.74\ndown to 0.68. These new parameters match with improved accuracy those of other\nindependent experiments. Our results indicate that there is still room for\nsignificant revision in the cosmological model parameters.",

        "title": "Bispectrum covariance in the flat-sky limit",
        "summary": "To probe cosmological fields beyond the Gaussian level, three-point\nstatistics can be used, all of which are related to the bispectrum. Hence,\nmeasurements of CMB anisotropies, galaxy clustering, and weak gravitational\nlensing alike have to rely upon an accurate theoretical background concerning\nthe bispectrum and its noise properties. If only small portions of the sky are\nconsidered, it is often desirable to perform the analysis in the flat-sky\nlimit. We aim at a formal, detailed derivation of the bispectrum covariance in\nthe flat-sky approximation, focusing on a pure two-dimensional Fourier-plane\napproach. We define an unbiased estimator of the bispectrum, which takes the\naverage over the overlap of annuli in Fourier space, and compute its full\ncovariance. The outcome of our formalism is compared to the flat-sky spherical\nharmonic approximation in terms of the covariance, the behavior under parity\ntransformations, and the information content. We introduce a geometrical\ninterpretation of the averaging process in the estimator, thus providing an\nintuitive understanding. Contrary to foregoing work, we find a difference by a\nfactor of two between the covariances of the Fourier-plane and the spherical\nharmonic approach. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained by the\ndiffering behavior with respect to parity. However, in an exemplary analysis it\nis demonstrated that the Fisher information of both formalisms agrees to high\naccuracy. Via the geometrical interpretation we are able to link the\nnormalization in the bispectrum estimator to the area enclosed by the triangle\nconfiguration at consideration as well as to the Wigner symbol, which leads to\nconvenient approximation formulae for the covariances of both approaches.",

        "summary": "The research area of nuclear astrophysics is characterized by a need for\ninformation published in tens of journals in several fields and an extremely\ndilute distribution of researchers. For these reasons it is difficult for\nresearchers, especially students, to be adequately informed of the relevant\npublished research. For example, the commonly employed journal club is\ninefficient for a group consisting of a professor and his two students. In an\nattempt to address this problem, we have developed a virtual journal (VJ), a\nprocess for collecting and distributing a weekly compendium of articles of\ninterest to researchers in nuclear astrophysics. Subscribers are notified of\neach VJ issue using an email-list server or an RSS feed. The VJ data base is\nsearchable by topics assigned by the editors, or by keywords. There are two\nrelated VJs: the Virtual Journal of Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA VJ), and the\nSEGUE Virtual Journal (SEGUE VJ). The JINA VJ also serves as a source of new\nexperimental and theoretical information for the JINA REACLIB reaction rate\ndatabase. References to review articles and popular level articles provide an\nintroduction to the literature for students.

        "title": "Time Calibration of the Radio Air Shower Array LOPES",
        "summary": "LOPES is a digitally read out antenna array consisting of 30 calibrated\ndipole antennas. It is located at the site of the KASCADE-Grande experiment at\nForschungszentrum Karlsruhe and measures the radio emission of cosmic ray air\nshowers in the frequency band from 40 to 80 MHz. LOPES is triggered by KASCADE\nand uses the KASCADE reconstruction of the shower axis as an input for the\nanalysis of the radio pulses. Thereby LOPES works as an interferometer when the\nsignal of all antennas is digitally merged to form a beam into the shower\ndirection. To be sensitive to the coherence of the radio signal, a precise time\ncalibration with an accuracy in the order of 1 ns is required. Thus, it is\nnecessary to know the delay of each antenna which is time and frequency\ndependent. Several calibration measurements are performed to correct for this\ndelay in the analysis: The group delay of every antenna is measured regularly\n(roughly once per year) by recording a test pulse which is emitted at a known\ntime. Furthermore, the delay is monitored continuously by the so called phase\ncalibration method: A beacon (a dipole antenna) emits continuously two sine\nwaves at 63.5 MHz and 68.1 MHz. By that a variation of the delay can be\ndetected in a subsequent analysis of the radio events as a change of the phase\nat these frequencies. Finally, the dispersion of the analog electronics has\nbeen measured to account for the frequency dependence of the delay.",

The method employs wavelet transformation which allows the\ndecomposition of the observed spectra into different scales.

This technique is applied to\nType Ia supernovae spectra, where correlations are revealed between the\nluminosity and spectral features. The current technique may allow for\nluminosity corrections based on spectral features in the use of Type Ia\nsupernovae as cosmological probe.",

Often, the agreement between these two kinds of spectra is not\nsatisfactory because of the strong influence of the grain morphology on the\nspectra. We investigate the ability of the statistical light-scattering model\nwith a distribution of form factors (DFF model) to reproduce experimentally\nmeasured infrared extinction spectra for particles that are small compared to\nthe wavelength. We take advantage of new experimental spectra measured for free\nparticles dispersed in air with accompanying information on the grain\nmorphology. For the calculations, we used DFFs that were derived for aggregates\nof spherical grains, as well as for compact grain shapes corresponding to\nGaussian random spheres. Irregular particle shapes require a DFF similar to\nthat of a Gaussian random sphere with sigma=0.3, whereas roundish grain shapes\nare best fitted with that of a fractal aggregate of a fractal dimension\n2.4-1.8. In addition we used a fitting algorithm to obtain the best-fit DFFs\nfor the various laboratory samples. In this way we can independently derive\ninformation on the shape of the grains from their infrared spectra. For\nanisotropic materials, different DFFs are needed for the different\ncrystallographic axes. This is due to a theoretical problem, which is inherent\nto all models that are simply averaging the contributions of the\ncrystallographic directions.",

The AMR implementation is\nbased on a hierarchy of grid patches with an oct-tree data structure. We adopt\na three-dimensional relaxing TVD scheme for the hydrodynamic solver, and a\nmulti-level relaxation scheme for the Poisson solver. Both solvers have been\nimplemented in GPU, by which hundreds of patches can be advanced in parallel.\nThe computational overhead associated with the data transfer between CPU and\nGPU is carefully reduced by utilizing the capability of asynchronous memory\ncopies in GPU, and the computing time of the ghost-zone values for each patch\nis made to diminish by overlapping it with the GPU computations. We demonstrate\nthe accuracy of the code by performing several standard test problems in\nastrophysics. GAMER is a parallel code that can be run in a multi-GPU cluster\nsystem. We measure the performance of the code by performing purely-baryonic\ncosmological simulations in different hardware implementations, in which\ndetailed timing analyses provide comparison between the computations with and\nwithout GPU(s) acceleration.

The paper applied TRIMOR to the\nalready available spectra of HD188753, a well known triple system, yielding the\nradial velocities of the faintest star in the system. This rendered the close\npair of the triple system a double-lined spectroscopic binary, which led to a\nprecise mass-ratio and an estimate of its inclination. The close-pair\ninclination is very close to the inclination of the wide orbit, consistent with\nthe assertion that this triple system has a close to coplanar configuration.",

        "summary": "A promising approach to measure the expected low flux of cosmic neutrinos at\nthe highest energies (E > 1 EeV) is acoustic detection. There are different\nin-situ test installations worldwide in water and ice to measure the acoustic\nproperties of the medium with regard to the feasibility of acoustic neutrino\ndetection. The parameters of interest include attenuation length, sound speed\nprofile, background noise level and transient backgrounds. The South Pole\nAcoustic Test Setup (SPATS) has been deployed in the upper 500 m of drill holes\nfor the IceCube neutrino observatory at the geographic South Pole. In-situ\ncalibration of sensors under the combined influence of low temperature, high\nambient pressure, and ice-sensor acoustic coupling is difficult. We discuss\nlaboratory calibrations in water and ice. Two new laboratory facilities, the\nAachen Acoustic Laboratory (AAL) and the Wuppertal Water Tank Test Facility,\nhave been set up. They offer large volumes of bubble free ice (3 m^3) and water\n(11 m^3) for the development, testing, and calibration of acoustic sensors.\nFurthermore, these facilities allow for verification of the thermoacoustic\nmodel of sound generation through energy deposition in the ice by a pulsed\nlaser. Results from laboratory measurements to disentangle the effects of the\ndifferent environmental influences and to test the thermoacoustic model are\npresented.",

        "summary": "This paper describes a new Heterodyne Array Receiver Programme (HARP) and\nAuto-Correlation Spectral Imaging System (ACSIS) that have recently been\ninstalled and commissioned on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The\n16-element focal-plane array receiver, operating in the submillimetre from 325\nto 375 GHz, offers high (three-dimensional) mapping speeds, along with\nsignificant improvements over single-detector counterparts in calibration and\nimage quality. Receiver temperatures are $\\sim$120 K across the whole band and\nsystem temperatures of $\\sim$300K are reached routinely under good weather\nconditions. The system includes a single-sideband filter so these are SSB\nfigures. Used in conjunction with ACSIS, the system can produce large-scale\nmaps rapidly, in one or more frequency settings, at high spatial and spectral\nresolution. Fully-sampled maps of size 1 square degree can be observed in under\n1 hour.\n  The scientific need for array receivers arises from the requirement for\nprogrammes to study samples of objects of statistically significant size, in\nlarge-scale unbiased surveys of galactic and extra-galactic regions. Along with\nmorphological information, the new spectral imaging system can be used to study\nthe physical and chemical properties of regions of interest. Its\nthree-dimensional imaging capabilities are critical for research into\nturbulence and dynamics. In addition, HARP/ACSIS will provide highly\ncomplementary science programmes to wide-field continuum studies, and produce\nthe essential preparatory work for submillimetre interferometers such as the\nSMA and ALMA.",

        "summary": "The detection of atmospheric fluorescence light from extensive air showers\nhas become a powerful tool for accurate measurements of the energy and mass of\nultra-high energy cosmic ray particles. Employing large area imaging telescopes\nwith mirror areas of 10m2 or more, showers out to distances of 30km and more\ncan be observed. Matrices of low-noise photomultipliers are used to detect the\nfaint light of the air showers against the ambient night-sky background noise.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio of such a system is found to be proportional to the\nsquare root of the mirror area times the quantum efficiency of the phototube.\nThus, higher quantum efficiencies could potentially improve the quality of the\nmeasurement and/or lead to the construction of more compact telescopes. In this\npaper, we shall discuss such improvements to be expected from high quantum\nefficiency phototubes that became available on the market only very recently. A\nseries of simulations has been performed with data of different types of\ncommercially available high quantum efficiency phototubes. The results suggest\na higher aperture and thus increased statistics for such telescopes.\nAdditionally, the quality of the reconstruction can be improved.",

        "summary": "According to current plans, the SIM/NASA mission will be launched just after\nthe end of operations for the Gaia/ESA mission. This is a new situation which\nenables long term astrometric projects that could not be achieved by either\nmission alone. Using the well-known perspective acceleration effect on\nastrometric measurements, the true heliocentric radial velocity of a nearby\nstar can be measured with great precision if the time baseline of the\nastrometric measurements is long enough. Since white dwarfs are compact\nobjects, the gravitational redshift can be quite large (40-80 km/s), and is the\npredominant source of any shift in wavelength. The mismatch of the true radial\nvelocity with the spectroscopic shift thus leads to a direct measure of the\nMass--Radius relation for such objects. Using available catalog information\nabout the known nearby white dwarfs, we estimate how many masses/gravitational\nredshift measurements can be obtained with an accuracy better than 2%. Nearby\nwhite dwarfs are relatively faint objects (10 < V < 15), which can be easily\nobserved by both missions. We also briefly discuss how the presence of a long\nperiod planet can mask the astrometric signal of perspective acceleration.",

        "title": "Accelerating Dust Temperature Calculations with Graphics Processing\n  Units",
        "summary": "When calculating the infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of\ngalaxies in radiation-transfer models, the calculation of dust grain\ntemperatures is generally the most time-consuming part of the calculation.\nBecause of its highly parallel nature, this calculation is perfectly suited for\nmassively parallel general-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper\npresents an implementation of the calculation of dust grain equilibrium\ntemperatures on GPUs in the Monte-Carlo radiation transfer code Sunrise, using\nthe CUDA API. The GPU can perform this calculation 69 times faster than the 8\nCPU cores, showing great potential for accelerating calculations of galaxy\nSEDs.",

        "summary": "We present a code, VeDyn, for modelling envelopes and atmospheres of A to F\nstars focusing on accurate treatment of convective processes. VeDyn implements\nthe highly sophisticated convection model of Canuto and Dubovikov (1998) but is\nfast and handy enough to be used in practical astrophysical applications. We\ndeveloped the HME envelope solver for this convection model furtheron to\nconsistently model the envelope together with the stellar atmosphere. The\nsynthesis code SynthV was extended to account for the resulting velocity\nstructure. Finally, we tested our approach on atomic line bisectors. It is\nshown that our synthetic line bisectors of HD108642 bend towards the blue and\nare of a magnitude comparable to the observed ones. Even though this approach\nof modelling convection requires the solution of a coupled system of nonlinear\ndifferential equations, it is fast enough to be applicable to many of the\ninvestigation techniques relying on model atmospheres.",

        "title": "Forthcoming Close Angular Approaches of Planets to Radio Sources and\n  Possibilities to Use Them as GR Tests",
        "summary": "During close angular approaches of solar system planets to astrometric radio\nsources, the apparent positions of these sources shift due to relativistic\neffects and, thus, these events may be used for testing the theory of general\nrelativity; this fact was successfully demonstrated in the experiments on the\nmeasurements of radio source position shifts during the approaches of Jupiter\ncarried out in 1988 and 2002. An analysis, performed within the frames of the\npresent work, showed that when a source is observed near a planet's disk edge,\ni.e., practically in the case of occultation, the current experimental accuracy\nmakes it possible to measure the relativistic effects for all planets. However,\nradio occultations are fairly rare events. At the same time, only Jupiter and\nSaturn provide noticeable relativistic effects approaching the radio sources at\nangular distances of about a few planet radii. Our analysis resulted in the\ncreation of a catalog of forthcoming occultations and approaches of planets to\nastrometric radio sources for the time period of 2008-2050, which can be used\nfor planning experiments on testing gravity theories and other purposes. For\nall events included in the catalog, the main relativistic effects are\ncalculated both for ground-based and space (Earth-Moon) interferometer\nbaselines.",

In our\nanalysis, first we used a non-linear ZZ Ceti light-curves simulator code to\nsimulate the variability of ZZ Ceti stars (we assumed stationary power spectra\nover five years). Second we used the Gaia nominal scanning law and the expected\nphotometric precision of Gaia to simulate ZZ Ceti time series with Gaia's time\nsampling and photometric errors. Then we performed a Fourier analysis of these\nsimulated time series. We found that a correct period can be recovered in ~65%\nof the cases if we consider Gaia per CCD time series of a G ~ 18 magnitude\nmultiperiodic ZZ Ceti star with 5%-10% light-curve variation. In the\npre-whitened power spectrum a second correct period was also recovered in ~26%\nof the cases.",

        "summary": "Efficient computation of the quadrupole light deflection for quasars/quasars\nand solar system objects within the framework of the baseline Gaia relativity\nmodel (GREM) is discussed. Two refinements have been achieved with the goal to\nimprove the performance of the model: First, the quadrupole deflection formulas\nfor both cases are simplified as much as possible considering the Gaia nominal\norbit (only approximate minimal distances between Gaia and the giant planets\nwere used here), physical parameters of the giant planets and the envisaged\naccuracy of 1 microarcsecond for individual systematic effects. The recommended\nformulas are given by Eq.(40) for stars/quasars and by Eq.(81) for solar system\nobjects. Second, simple expressions for the upper estimate of the quadrupole\nlight deflection have been found allowing, with a few additional arithmetical\noperations, to judge a priori if the quadrupole light deflection should be\ncomputed or not for a given source and for a given requested accuracy. The\nrecommended criteria are given by Eq.(45) for stars/quasars and by Eq.(92) for\nsolar system objects. Additionally, the quadrupole Shapiro effect for solar\nsystem objects is reconsidered. A strict upper bound of quadrupole Shapiro\neffect for solar system objects is given in Eq.(109).",

Simulations of\nsuch measurements assuming only thermal noise in the astronomical and WVR\nreceivers are presented and it is shown that accurate determination of the\nempirical relationship should be possible in a relatively short time. It is\nthen proposed that the best way of using these empirical coefficients is to\ninclude them as a constraint on a physical model of the atmosphere -- this\nallows them to be used for longer period of time, increasing the efficiency of\nobserving. This approach fits naturally into the analysis framework presented\nin the previous memo, which has now been extended to implement it.

Significant\nimprovement is expected in the sensitivity of the Tibet AS array towards\ncelestial gamma-ray signals above 10 TeV by utilizing the fact that\ngamma-ray-induced air showers contain far fewer muons compared with\ncosmic-ray-induced ones. We carried out detailed Monte Carlo simulations to\nassess the attainable sensitivity of the Tibet AS+MD array towards celestial\nTeV gamma-ray signals. Based on the simulation results, the Tibet AS+MD array\nwill be able to reject 99.99% of background events at 100 TeV, with 83% of\ngamma-ray events remaining. The sensitivity of the Tibet AS+MD array will be\n~20 times better than that of the present Tibet AS array around 20 - 100 TeV.\nThe Tibet AS+MD array will measure the directions of the celestial TeV\ngamma-ray sources and the cutoffs of their energy spectra. Furthermore, the\nTibet AS+MD array, along with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes as well\nas the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and X-ray satellites such as Suzaku and\nMAXI, will make multiwavelength observations and conduct morphological studies\non sources in the quest for evidence of the hadronic nature of the cosmic-ray\nacceleration mechanism.",

A pure\n\"visibility\" effect was also present: the subset of articles accidentally in\nearly positions fared measurably better in the long-term citation record than\nthose lower down. Astrophysics articles announced in position 1, for example,\noverall received a median number of citations 83\\% higher, while those there\naccidentally had a 44\\% visibility boost. For two large subcommunities of\ntheoretical high energy physics, hep-th and hep-ph articles announced in\nposition 1 had median numbers of citations 50\\% and 100\\% larger than for\npositions 5--15, and the subsets there accidentally had visibility boosts of\n38\\% and 71\\%.\n  We also consider the positional effects on early readership. The median\nnumbers of early full text downloads for astro-ph, hep-th, and hep-ph articles\nannounced in position 1 were 82\\%, 61\\%, and 58\\% higher than for lower\npositions, respectively, and those there accidentally had medians\nvisibility-boosted by 53\\%, 44\\%, and 46\\%. Finally, we correlate a variety of\nreadership features with long-term citations, using machine learning methods,\nthereby extending previous results on the predictive power of early readership\nin a broader context. We conclude with some observations on impact metrics and\ndangers of recommender mechanisms.",

        "summary": "We present spatially-resolved K- and L-band spectra (at spectral resolution R\n= 230 and R = 60, respectively) of MWC 419, a Herbig Ae/Be star. The data were\nobtained simultaneously with a new configuration of the 85-m baseline Keck\nInterferometer. Our observations are sensitive to the radial distribution of\ntemperature in the inner region of the disk of MWC 419. We fit the visibility\ndata with both simple geometric and more physical disk models. The geometric\nmodels (uniform disk and Gaussian) show that the apparent size increases\nlinearly with wavelength in the 2-4 microns wavelength region, suggesting that\nthe disk is extended with a temperature gradient. A model having a power-law\ntemperature gradient with radius simultaneously fits our interferometric\nmeasurements and the spectral energy distribution data from the literature. The\nslope of the power-law is close to that expected from an optically thick disk.\nOur spectrally dispersed interferometric measurements include the Br gamma\nemission line. The measured disk size at and around Br gamma suggests that\nemitting hydrogen gas is located inside (or within the inner regions) of the\ndust disk.",

        "title": "An Alignment System for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes",
        "summary": "The reflector used by an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT)\nconsists of a tessellated array of mirrors mounted on a large frame. This\narrangement allows for a very large reflecting surface with sufficient optical\nquality for the implementation of the IACT technique at a moderate price. The\nmain challenge presented by such a reflector is maintaining the optical\nquality, which depends on the individual alignment of several hundred mirror\nfacets. We describe a method of measuring and correcting the alignment of the\nmirror facets of the reflectors used by the VERITAS telescopes. This method\nemploys a CCD camera, placed at the focal point of the reflector, which\nacquires a series of images of the reflector while the telescope performs a\nraster scan about a star. Well-aligned facets appear bright when the telescope\npoints directly at the star while misaligned facets appear bright when the\nangle between the telescope pointing direction and the star is twice the\nmisalignment angle of the mirror. Data from these scans can therefore be used\nto produce a set of corrections which can be applied to the facets. In this\ncontribution we report on initial experience with an alignment system based on\nthis principle.",

        "title": "The X-ray Properties of the Energetic Pulsar PSR J1838-0655",
        "summary": "We present and interpret several new X-ray features of the X-ray pulsar PSR\nJ1838-0655. The X-ray data are obtained from the archival data of CHANDRA,\nRXTE}, and SUZAKU. We combine all these X-ray data and fit the spectra with\ndifferent models. We find that the joint spectra are difficult to fit with a\nsingle power law; a broken power-law model with a break at around 6.5 keV can\nimprove the fit significantly. The photon index changes from $\\Gamma$ = 1.0\n(below 6.5 keV) to $\\Gamma$ = 1.5 (above 6.5 keV); this indicates a softer\nspectral behaviour at hard X-rays. The X-ray flux at 2-20 keV is found to be\n1.6x10^{-11} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The conversion efficiency from the spin-down\nluminosity is ~ 0.9% at 0.8-10 keV, which is much higher than that (~ 10^{-3}%\n- 10^{-4}%) of the pulsars that show similar timing properties. We discuss\nnon-thermal radiation mechanisms for the observed high X-ray conversion\nefficiency and find that emission from the magnetosphere of a greatly inclined\nrotator is the most favorable interpretation for the conversion rate and the\npulse profiles at X-ray bands. A line feature close to 6.65 keV is also\ndetected in the spectra of SUZAKU/XIS; it might be the K$_\\alpha$ emission of\nhighly ionised Fe surrounding the pulsar.",

        "summary": "Interferometry provides one of the possible routes to ultra-high angular\nresolution for X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. Sub-micro-arc-second angular\nresolution, necessary to achieve objectives such as imaging the regions around\nthe event horizon of a super-massive black hole at the center of an active\ngalaxy, can be achieved if beams from parts of the incoming wavefront separated\nby 100s of meters can be stably and accurately brought together at small\nangles. One way of achieving this is by using grazing incidence mirrors. We\nhere investigate an alternative approach in which the beams are recombined by\noptical elements working in transmission. It is shown that the use of\ndiffractive elements is a particularly attractive option. We report\nexperimental results from a simple 2-beam interferometer using a low-cost\ncommercially available profiled film as the diffractive elements. A\nrotationally symmetric filled (or mostly filled) aperture variant of such an\ninterferometer, equivalent to an X-ray axicon, is shown to offer a much wider\nbandpass than either a Phase Fresnel Lens (PFL) or a PFL with a refractive lens\nin an achromatic pair. Simulations of an example system are presented.",

We present a strictly template-based photometric redshift\nestimator and compute redshift reconstruction errors in the presence of\nphotometry and statistical errors.

        "title": "Exploring intermediate and massive black-hole binaries with the Einstein\n  Telescope",
        "summary": "We discuss the capability of a third-generation ground-based detector such as\nthe Einstein Telescope (ET) to enhance our astrophysical knowledge through\ndetections of gravitational waves emitted by binaries including\nintermediate-mass and massive black holes. The design target for such\ninstruments calls for improved sensitivity at low frequencies, specifically in\nthe ~ 1-10 Hz range. This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses. We primarily discuss two different source types --\nmergers between two intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass,\nand intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with\nmass ~ 1-10 solar masses into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in\ndark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of\nvery massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar\ncollisions in globular clusters. In this paper, we will discuss both formation\nchannels, and both classes of merger in each case. We review existing rate\nestimates where these exist in the literature, and provide some new\ncalculations for the approximate numbers of events that will be seen by a\ndetector like the Einstein Telescope. These results indicate that the ET may\nsee a few to a few thousand comparable-mass IMBH mergers and as many as several\nhundred IMRI events per year. These observations will significantly enhance our\nunderstanding of galactic black-hole growth, of the existence and properties of\nIMBHs and of the astrophysics of globular clusters. We finish our review with a\ndiscussion of some more speculative sources of gravitational waves for the ET,\nincluding hypermassive white dwarfs and eccentric stellar-mass compact-object\nbinaries.",

        "summary": "Neutrino telescopes are opening new opportunities in observational high\nenergy astrophysics. In these detectors, atmospheric muons from primary cosmic\nray interactions in the atmosphere play an important role. They provide the\nmost abundant source of events for calibration and for testing the\nreconstruction algorithms. On the other hand, they represent the major\nbackground source. The simulation of a statistically significant number of\nmuons in large volume neutrino telescopes requires a big effort in terms of\ncomputing time. Some parameterizations are currently available, but they do not\nexplicitly take into account the arrival of muons in bundles. A fast Monte\nCarlo generator (MUPAGE) was developed to generate single and multiple\natmospheric muon events in underwater/ice neutrino telescopes. The code reduces\nthe computing time for the simulation of atmospheric muons significantly. The\nevent kinematics is produced on the surface of a user-defined cylinder,\nvirtually surrounding the detector volume. The flux of muon bundles at\ndifferent depths and zenith angles, the lateral spread and the energy spectrum\nof the muons in the bundles are based on parametric formulas. These formulas\nwere obtained according to a specific primary cosmic ray flux model and\nconstrained by the measurements of the muon flux in the MACRO underground\nexperiment. Some MUPAGE applications are presented.",

        "summary": "A fast trigger system is being designed as a potential upgrade to VERITAS, or\nas the basis for a future array of imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes\nsuch as AGIS. The scientific goal is a reduction of the energy threshold by a\nfactor of 2 over the current threshold of VERITAS of around 130 GeV. The\ntrigger is being designed to suppress both accidentals from the night-sky\nbackground and cosmic rays. The trigger uses field-programmable gate arrays\n(FPGAs) so that it is adaptable to different observing modes and special\nphysics triggers, e.g. pulsars. The trigger consists of three levels: The level\n1 (L1.5) trigger operating on each telescope camera samples the discriminated\npixels at a rate of 400 MHz and searches for nearest-neighbor coincidences. In\nL1.5, the received discriminated signals are delay-compensated with an accuracy\nof 0.078 ns, facilitating a short coincidence time-window between any nearest\nneighbor of 5 ns. The hit pixels are then sent to a second trigger level (L2)\nthat parameterizes the image shape and transmits this information along with a\nGPS time stamp to the array-level trigger (L3) at a rate of 10 MHz via a fiber\noptic link. The FPGA-based event analysis on L3 searches for coincident\ntime-stamps from multiple telescopes and carries out a comparison of the image\nparameters against a look-up table at a rate of 10 kHz. A test of the\nsingle-telescope trigger was carried out in spring 2009 on one VERITAS\ntelescope.",

It is, however, a key to study the general properties\nof the interstellar medium of galaxies, as it contains important spectral line\ndiagnostics from the neutral, ionized and molecular ISM. The Herschel Space\nObservatory, successfully launched on 14 May 2009, is the first observatory to\ncover the entire FIR/submm range between 57 and 672 mum. We discuss the main\nresults from the ISO era on FIR spectroscopy of galaxies and the enormous\nscience potential of the Herschel mission through a presentation of its\nspectroscopic extragalactic key programs.",

The\nprimary objective of GBM is to extend the energy range over which bursts are\nobserved downward from the energy range of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on\nFermi into the hard X-ray range where extensive previous data exist. A\nsecondary objective is to compute burst locations on-board to allow\nre-orientiong the spacecraft so that the LAT can observe delayed emission from\nbright bursts. GBM uses an array of twelve sodium iodide scintillators and two\nbismuth germanate scintillators to detect gamma rays from ~8 keV to ~40 MeV\nover the full unocculted sky. The on-board trigger threshold is ~0.7\nphotons/cm2/s (50-300 keV, 1 s peak). GBM generates on-board triggers for ~250\nGRBs per year.",

        "summary": "Transiting extrasolar planets provide an opportunity to study the mass-radius\nrelation of planets as well as their internal structure. The existence of a\nsecondary eclipse enables further study of the thermal properties of the the\nplanet by observing at infrared wavelengths. The probability of an observable\nsecondary eclipse depends upon the orbital parameters of the planet,\nparticularly eccentricity and argument of periastron. Here we provide\nanalytical expressions for these probabilities, investigate their properties,\nand calculate their values for the known extrasolar planets. We furthermore\nquantitatively discuss constraints on existence and observability of primary\ntransits if a secondary eclipse is observed. Finally, we calculate the\na-posteriori transit probabilities of the known extrasolar planets, and we\npresent several case studies in which orbital constraints resulting from the\npresence of a secondary eclipse may be applied in observing campaigns.",

        "title": "Simulations of the Microwave Sky",
        "summary": "We create realistic, full-sky, half-arcminute resolution simulations of the\nmicrowave sky matched to the most recent astrophysical observations. The\nprimary purpose of these simulations is to test the data reduction pipeline for\nthe Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment; however, we have widened the\nfrequency coverage beyond the ACT bands to make these simulations applicable to\nother microwave background experiments. Some of the novel features of these\nsimulations are that the radio and infrared galaxy populations are correlated\nwith the galaxy cluster populations, the CMB is lensed by the dark matter\nstructure in the simulation via a ray-tracing code, the contribution to the\nthermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals from galaxy clusters,\ngroups, and the IGM has been included, and the gas prescription to model the SZ\nsignals matches the most recent X-ray observations. Regarding the contamination\nof cluster SZ flux by radio galaxies, we find for 148 GHz (90 GHz) only 3% (4%)\nof halos have their SZ decrements contaminated at a level of 20% or more. We\nfind the contamination levels higher for infrared galaxies. However, at 90 GHz,\nless than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<1.2 have\ntheir SZ decrements filled in at a level of 20% or more. At 148 GHz, less than\n20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<0.8 have their SZ\ndecrements filled in at a level of 50% or larger. Our models also suggest that\na population of very high flux infrared galaxies, which are likely lensed\nsources, contribute most to the SZ contamination of very massive clusters at 90\nand 148 GHz. These simulations are publicly available and should serve as a\nuseful tool for microwave surveys to cross-check SZ cluster detection, power\nspectrum, and cross-correlation analyses.",

        "summary": "In this review we consider various ring structures that are observed in\ngalaxies. Formation and evolution of the rings are interesting problems in\nstudies of galactic morphology. They are related to such fundamental aspects of\ngalactic evolution and dynamics as the nature and distribution of the dark\nmatter in galaxies, galactic interactions and internal secular evolution of\ngalactic substructures. A significant fraction of galactic rings forms in the\ndisks due to gravitational torques from bar-like patterns. In contrast to this\ninternally driven origin, the phenomenon of the polar-ring galaxies is closely\nconnected with the processes of intergalactic interactions and merging. A rare\nclass of collisional rings reveals the density waves triggered in the stellar\nand gaseous disks after a strong head-on collision with a companion. We briefly\nreview the status of studies of gas kinematics in the rings of different\norigin. We stress that velocity fields of the ionized gas obtained with the\nFabry-Perot interferometers provide a very important information for these\nstudies.",

        "summary": "A difficult task with many particle detectors focusing on interactions below\n~100 keV is to perform a calibration in the appropriate energy range that\nadequately probes all regions of the detector. Because detector response can\nvary greatly in various locations within the device, a spatially uniform\ncalibration is important. We present a new method for calibration of liquid\nxenon (LXe) detectors, using the short-lived 83m-Kr. This source has\ntransitions at 9.4 and 32.1 keV, and as a noble gas like Xe, it disperses\nuniformly in all regions of the detector. Even for low source activities, the\nexistence of the two transitions provides a method of identifying the decays\nthat is free of background. We find that at decreasing energies, the LXe light\nyield increases, while the amount of electric field quenching is diminished.\nAdditionally, we show that if any long-lived radioactive backgrounds are\nintroduced by this method, they will present less than 67E-6 events/kg/day in\nthe next generation of LXe dark matter direct detection searches",

        "summary": "We developed an instrument design capable of measuring linear X-ray\npolarization over a broad-band using conventional spectroscopic optics. A set\nof multilayer-coated flats reflects the dispersed X-rays to the instrument\ndetectors. The intensity variation with position angle is measured to determine\nthree Stokes parameters: I, Q, and U -- all as a function of energy. By\nlaterally grading the multilayer optics and matching the dispersion of the\ngratings, one may take advantage of high multilayer reflectivities and achieve\nmodulation factors > 50% over the entire 0.2 to 0.8 keV band. This instrument\ncould be used in a small orbiting mission or scaled up for the International\nX-ray Observatory. Laboratory work has begun that would demonstrate the\ncapabilities of key components.",

        "summary": "We investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) for\nmeasuring the magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies via Faraday rotation of\nbackground polarised sources. [...] We find that about 10 per cent of the sky\nis covered by a significant extragalactic Faraday screen. Most of it has\nrotation measures between 10 and 100 rad/m/m. We argue that the cluster centres\nshould have up to about 5000 rad/m/m. We show that the proposed mid frequency\naperture array of the SKA as well as the lowest band of the SKA dish array are\nwell suited to make measurements for most of these rotation measure values,\ntypically requiring a signal-to-noise of ten. We calculate the spacing of\nsources forming a grid for the purpose of measuring foreground rotation\nmeasures: it reaches a spacing of 36 arcsec for a 100 hour SKA observation per\nfield. We also calculate the statistics for background RM measurements in\nclusters of galaxies. We find that a first phase of the SKA would allow us to\ntake stacking experiments out to high redshifts (>1), and provide improved\nmagnetic field structure measurements for individual nearby clusters. The full\nSKA aperture array would be able to make very detailed magnetic field structure\nmeasurements of clusters with more than 100 background sources per cluster up\nto a redshift of 0.5 and more than 1000 background sources per cluster for\nnearby clusters, and could for reasonable assumptions about future measurements\nof electron densities in high redshift clusters constrain the power law index\nfor the magnetic field evolution to better than dm=0.4, if the magnetic field\nin clusters should follow B ~ (1+z)^m.",

Though the primary aim\nof the ANTARES neutrino telescope is the detection of high energy cosmic\nneutrinos, the detector measures mainly down-doing muons, which are decay\nproducts of cosmic-rays collisions in the Earth's atmosphere.

Core optimizations\ninclude the bit-fielding of integer data and iterative methods that complement\na new Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) kernel, which efficiently calculates the\nmatrix vector products required by these iterative solution schemes. The new\nkernel performs the requisite 3-D DFTs as ensembles of 1-D transforms, and by\ndoing so, is able to reduce the number of constituent 1-D transforms by 60% and\nthe memory by over 80%. The optimizations also facilitate the use of parallel\ntechniques to further enhance the performance. Complete OpenMP-based\nshared-memory and MPI-based distributed-memory implementations have been\ncreated to take full advantage of the various architectures. Several benchmarks\nof the new framework indicate extremely favorable performance and scalability.\nOpenDDA is available following the usual open source regulations from\nhttp://www.opendda.org",

This data acquisition\nsystem showed excellent stability and flexibility since the detector became\noperational in March 2006. The applied concept enables to operate different\nphysics triggers to the same data in parallel, each optimized for a specific\n(astro)physics signal. The list of triggers includes two general purpose muon\ntriggers, a Galactic Centre trigger, and a gamma-ray burst trigger. The\nperformance of the data acquisition system is evaluated by its operational\nefficiency and the data filter capabilities.

The telescope consists of 12\ndetect or lines housing a total of 884 optical modules. Each line is anchored\nto the seabed and pulled taught by the buoyancy of the individual optical\nmodules and a top buoy. Due to the fluid nature of the sea-water detecting\nmedium and the flexible nature of the detector lines, the optical modules of\nthe ANTARES telescope can suffer from deviations of up to several meters from\nthe vertical and as such, real time positioning is needed. Real time\npositioning of the ANTARES telescope is achieved by a combination of an\nacoustic positioning system and a lattice of tiltmeters and compasses. These\nindependent and complementary systems are used to compute a global fit to each\nindividual detector line, allowing us to construct a 3 dimensional picture of\nthe ANTARES neutrino telescope with an accuracy of less than 10 cm. In this\npaper we describe the positioning system of the ANTARES neutrino telescope and\ndiscuss its performance during the first year of 12 line data taking.",

        "summary": "In May 2008, the Antares neutrino telescope was completed at 2.5 km depth in\nthe Mediterranean Sea; data taking has been going on since. A prerequisite for\nneutrino astronomy is an accurate reconstruction of the neutrino events, as\nwell as a detailed understanding of the atmospheric muon and neutrino\nbackgrounds. Several methods have been developed to confront the challenges of\nmuon reconstruction in the sea water environment, which are posed by e.g.\nbackgrounds due to radioactivity and bioluminescence. I will discuss the\ntechniques that allowed Antares to confidently identify its first neutrino\nevents, as well as recent results on the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos.",

        "summary": "Satellites that are capable of detecting gamma-ray bursts can trigger the\nAntares neutrino telescope via the real-time gamma-ray bursts coordinates\nnetwork. Thanks to the \"all-data-to-shore\" concept that is implemented in the\ndata acquisition system of Antares, the sensitivity to neutrinos from gamma-ray\nbursts is significantly increased when a gamma-ray burst is detected by these\nsatellites. The performance of the satellite-triggered data taking is shown, as\nwell as the resulting gain in detection efficiency. Different search methods\ncan be applied to the data taken in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts. For\ngamma-ray bursts above the Antares horizon, for which a neutrino signal is more\ndifficult to find, an analysis method is applied to detect muons induced by the\nhigh-energy gamma rays from the source.",

        "summary": "The origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and neutrinos is still a\nmystery. Hadronic acceleration theory suggests that they should originate in\nthe same sources (astrophysical or cosmological), together with gamma-rays.\nWhile gamma-rays have been linked to astrophysical sources, no point source of\nUHECRs or neutrinos have been found so far. In this paper, the multimessenger\ncombination of UHECRs and neutrinos as a new approach to the high energy\nparticle point source search is suggested. A statistical method for\ncross-correlation of UHECR and neutrino data sets is proposed. By obtaining the\nprobability density function of number of neutrino events within chosen angular\ndistance from observed UHECRs, the number of neutrino events in the vicinity of\nobserved UHECRs, necessary to claim a discovery with a chosen significance, can\nbe calculated. Different angular distances (bin sizes) are considered due to\nthe unknown deflection of cosmic rays in galactic and intergalactic magnetic\nfields. Possible observed correlation of the arrival directions of UHECRs and\nneutrinos would provide a strong indication of hadronic acceleration theory.\nCorrelation of both types of messengers with the location of certain sets of\nobserved astrophysical objects would indicate sites of acceleration. Any\nsystematic offset in arrival directions between UHECRs and neutrinos may shed\nmore light on magnetic field deflection of cosmic rays.",

Diverse Field Spectroscopy allows arbitrary distributions of target\nregions to be addressed to optimise observing efficiency when observing\ncomplex, clumpy structures such as protoclusters which will be increasingly\naccessible to Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTS). We show how the adoption of\nvarious types of remapping between the input and output of a Monolithic Fibre\nSystems can allow contiguous regions of spatial elements to be selected using\nonly simple switch arrays. Finally we show how this compares in efficiency with\nintegral-field and multiobject spectroscopy by simulations using artificial and\nreal catalogues of objects. With the adoption of these mapping strategies, DFS\noutperforms other techniques when addressing a range of realistic target\ndistributions.

        "title": "Testing the Epeak - Eiso relation for GRBs detected by Swift and\n  Suzaku-WAM",
        "summary": "One of the most prominent, yet controversial associations derived from the\nensemble of prompt-phase observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is the\napparent correlation in the source frame between the peak energy Epeak) of the\nnu-F(nu) spectrum and the isotropic radiated energy, Eiso. Since most gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) have Epeak above the energy range (15-150 keV) of the Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) on Swift, determining accurate Epeak values for large numbers\nof Swift bursts has been difficult. However, by combining data from Swift/BAT\nand the Suzaku Wide-band All-Sky Monitor (WAM), which covers the energy range\nfrom 50-5000 keV, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one can\naccurately fit Epeak and Eiso and test the relationship between them for the\nSwift sample. Between the launch of Suzaku in July 2005 and the end of April\n2009, there were 48 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which triggered both Swift/BAT and\nWAM and an additional 48 bursts which triggered Swift and were detected by WAM,\nbut did not trigger. A BAT-WAM team has cross-calibrated the two instruments\nusing GRBs, and we are now able to perform joint fits on these bursts to\ndetermine their spectral parameters. For those bursts with spectroscopic\nredshifts, we can also calculate the isotropic energy. Here we present the\nresults of joint Swift/BAT-Suzaku/WAM spectral fits for 91 of the bursts\ndetected by the two instruments. We show that the distribution of spectral fit\nparameters is consistent with distributions from earlier missions and confirm\nthat Swift bursts are consistent with earlier reported relationships between\nEpeak and isotropic energy. We show through time-resolved spectroscopy that\nindividual burst pulses are also consistent with this relationship.",

        "summary": "Gamma-rays provide a powerful insight into the non-thermal universe and\nperhaps a unique probe for new physics beyond the standard model. Current\nexperiments are already giving results in the physics of acceleration of cosmic\nrays in supernova remnants, pulsar and active galactic nuclei with almost a\nhundred sources detected at very-high-energies so far. Despite its relatively\nrecent appearance, very high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has proven to have\nreached a mature technology with fast assembling, relatively cheap and reliable\ntelescopes. The goal of future installation is to increase the sensitivity by a\nfactor ten compared to current installations, and enlarge the energy domain\nfrom few tens of GeV to a hundred TeV. Gamma-ray spectra of astrophysical\norigin are rather soft thus hardly one single size telescope can cover more\nthan 1.5 decades in energy, therefore an array of telescopes of 2,3 different\nsizes is required. Hereafter, we present design considerations for a Cherenkov\nTelescope Array (CTA), a project for a new generation of highly automated\ntelescopes for gamma-ray astronomy. The status of the project, technical\nsolutions and an insight in the involved physics will be presented.",

We split the Hamiltonian of a self-gravitating fluid\nsystem to the gravitational potential and others (kinetic and internal\nenergies) and use different time-steps for their integrations. The time\nintegration is done in the way similar to that used in the mixed variable or\nmultiple stepsize symplectic schemes. We performed three test calculations. One\nwas the spherical collapse and the other was an explosion. We also performed a\nrealistic test, in which the initial model was taken from a simulation of\nmerging galaxies. In all test calculations, we found that the number of\ntime-steps for gravitational interaction were reduced by nearly an order of\nmagnitude when we adopted our integration method. In the case of the realistic\ntest, in which the dark matter potential dominates the total system, the total\ncalculation time was significantly reduced. Simulation results were almost the\nsame with those of simulations with the ordinary individual time-step method.\nOur new method achieves good performance without sacrificing the accuracy of\nthe time integration.",

        "summary": "We describe the design and performance of polarization selective\nantenna-coupled TES arrays that will be used in several upcoming Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) experiments: SPIDER, BICEP-2/SPUD. The fully\nlithographic polarimeter arrays utilize planar phased-antennas for collimation\n(F/4 beam) and microstrip filters for band definition (25% bandwidth). These\ndevices demonstrate high optical efficiency, excellent beam shapes, and\nwell-defined spectral bands. The dual-polarization antennas provide\nwell-matched beams and low cross polarization response, both important for\nhigh-fidelity polarization measurements. These devices have so far been\ndeveloped for the 100 GHz and 150 GHz bands, two premier millimeter-wave\natmospheric windows for CMB observations. In the near future, the flexible\nmicrostrip-coupled architecture can provide photon noise-limited detection for\nthe entire frequency range of the CMBPOL mission.

        "title": "Strategies for spectroscopy on Extremely Large Telescopes. I - Image\n  Slicing",
        "summary": "One of the problems of producing spectrographs for Extremely Large Telescopes\n(ELTs) is that the beam size is required to scale with telescope aperture if\nall other parameters are held constant, leading to enormous size and implied\ncost. This is a particular problem for image sizes much larger than the\ndiffraction limit, as is likely to be the case if Adaptive Optics systems are\nnot initially able to deliver highly corrected images over the full field of\nthe instrument or if signal/noise considerations require large spatial samples.\nIn this case, there is a potential advantage in image slicing to reduce the\neffective slitwidth and hence the beam size. However, this implies larger\ndetectors and oversizing of the optics which may cancel out the advantage. By\nthe means of a toy model of a spectrograph whose dimensions are calibrated\nusing existing instruments, the size and relative cost of spectrographs for\nELTs have been estimated. Using a range of scaling laws derived from the\nreference instruments, it is possible to estimate the uncertainties in the\npredictions and to explore the consequences of different design strategies. The\nmodel predicts major cost savings (2 - 100x) by slicing with factors of 5-20\ndepending on the type of spectrograph. The predictions suggest that it is\nbetter to accommodate the multiplicity of slices within a single spectrograph\nrather than distribute them among smaller, cheaper replicas in a parallel\narchitecture, but the replication option provides an attractive upgrade path to\nintegral field spectroscopy (IFS) as the input image quality is improved...\n[Full abstract in text]",

Previous theoretical and numerical methods are inadequate for\naccurate computations of the return flux and hence for the design of the\nnext-generation LGS systems.\n  Aims: We numerically optimize the cw (continuous wave) laser format, in\nparticular the light polarization and spectrum.\n  Methods: Using Bloch equations, we simulate the mesospheric sodium atoms,\nincluding Doppler broadening, saturation, collisional relaxation, Larmor\nprecession, and recoil, taking into account all 24 sodium hyperfine states and\non the order of 100 velocity groups.\n  Results: LGS return flux is limited by \"three evils\": Larmor precession due\nto the geomagnetic field, atomic recoil due to radiation pressure, and\ntransition saturation. We study their impacts and show that the return flux can\nbe boosted by repumping (simultaneous excitation of the sodium D2a and D2b\nlines with 10-20% of the laser power in the latter).\n  Conclusions: We strongly recommend the use of circularly polarized lasers and\nrepumping. As a rule of thumb, the bandwidth of laser radiation in MHz (at each\nline) should approximately equal the launched laser power in Watts divided by\nsix, assuming a diffraction-limited spot size.",

This versatile and\neasy-to-operate instrument has been used over the past three years for a wide\nvariety of projects. This paper first reviews the basic principles of FP\ntunable filters, then provides a detailed description of the hardware and\nsoftware associated with MMTF and the techniques developed to observe with this\ninstrument and reduce the data.

        "summary": "Today, the motion of spacecraft is still described by the classical Newtonian\nequations of motion plus some relativistic corrections. This approach might\nbecome cumbersome due to the increasing precision required. We use the\nRelativistic Motion Integrator (RMI) approach to numerically integrate the\nnative relativistic equations of motion for a spacecraft. The principle of RMI\nis presented. We compare the results obtained with the RMI method with those\nfrom the usual Newton plus correction approach for the orbit of the BepiColombo\n(around Mercury) and Mars-NEXT (around Mars) orbiters. Finally, we present a\nnumerical study of RMI and we show that the RMI approach is relevant to study\nthe orbit of spacecraft.",

        "summary": "With a collecting area of 70 000 m^2, the Five hundred metre Aperture\nSpherical Telescope (FAST) will allow for great advances in pulsar astronomy.\nWe have performed simulations to estimate the number of previously unknown\npulsars FAST will find with its 19-beam or possibly 100-beam receivers for\ndifferent survey strategies. With the 19-beam receiver, a total of 5200\npreviously unknown pulsars could be discovered in the Galactic plane, including\nabout 460 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Such a survey would take just over 200\ndays with eight hours survey time per day. We also estimate that, with about 80\nsix-hour days, a survey of M31 and M33 could yield 50--100 extra-Galactic\npulsars. A 19-beam receiver would produce just under 500 MB of data per second\nand requires about 9 tera-ops to perform the major part of a real time\nanalysis. We also simulate the logistics of high-precision timing of MSPs with\nFAST. Timing of the 50 brightest MSPs to a signal-to-noise of 500 would take\nabout 24 hours per epoch.",

        "title": "The Warm Molecular Gas Around the Cloverleaf Quasar",
        "summary": "We present the first broadband lambda = 1 mm spectrum toward the z=2.56\nCloverleaf Quasar, obtained with Z-Spec, a 1-mm grating spectrograph on the\n10.4-meter Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. The 190-305 GHz observation band\ncorresponds to rest-frame 272 to 444 microns, and we measure the dust continuum\nas well as all four transitions of carbon monoxide (CO) lying in this range.\nThe power-law dust emission, F_nu = 14 mJy (nu/240GHz)^3.9 is consistent with\nthe published continuum measurements. The CO J=6->5, J=8->7, and J=9->8\nmeasurements are the first, and now provide the highest-J CO information in\nthis source. Our measured CO intensities are very close to the\npreviously-published interferometric measurements of J=7->6, and we use all\navailable transitions and our 13CO upper limits to constrain the physical\nconditions in the Cloverleaf molecular gas disk. We find a large mass\n(2-50x10^9 Msun) of highly-excited gas with thermal pressure nT > 10^6 Kcm^-3.\nThe ratio of the total CO cooling to the far-IR dust emission exceeds that in\nthe local dusty galaxies, and we investigate the potential heating sources for\nthis bulk of warm molecular gas. We conclude that both UV photons and X-rays\nlikely contribute, and discuss implications for a top-heavy stellar initial\nmass function arising in the X-ray-irradiated starburst. Finally we present\ntentative identifications of other species in the spectrum, including a\npossible detection of the H20 2_0,2->1_1,1 transition at lambda_rest = 303\nmicrons.",

On the other hand, augmenting the filter set to include\nlonger-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter increases the range\nof masses and ages that can be accurately measured with unresolved photometry.\nNevertheless, a relatively large range of masses and ages is found to be\ndominated by SIMF sampling effects that render the observed masses useless,\neven when using UBVRIJHK photometry.",

For the same reasons, such messengers could also reveal\nnew, hidden sources that were not observed by conventional photon astronomy.\n  Requiring the consistency between GW and HEN detection channels shall enable\nnew searches as one has significant additional information about the common\nsource. A neutrino telescope such as ANTARES can determine accurately the time\nand direction of high energy neutrino events, while a network of gravitational\nwave detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO can also provide timing/directional\ninformation for gravitational wave bursts.

        "title": "Detecting Variability in Massive Astronomical Time-Series Data I:\n  application of an infinite Gaussian mixture model",
        "summary": "We present a new framework to detect various types of variable objects within\nmassive astronomical time-series data. Assuming that the dominant population of\nobjects is non-variable, we find outliers from this population by using a\nnon-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm based on an infinite\nGaussianMixtureModel (GMM) and the Dirichlet Process. The algorithm extracts\ninformation from a given dataset, which is described by six variability\nindices. The GMM uses those variability indices to recover clusters that are\ndescribed by six-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions, allowing our\napproach to consider the sampling pattern of time-series data, systematic\nbiases, the number of data points for each light curve, and photometric\nquality. Using the Northern Sky Variability Survey data, we test our approach\nand prove that the infinite GMM is useful at detecting variable objects, while\nproviding statistical inference estimation that suppresses false detection. The\nproposed approach will be effective in the exploration of future surveys such\nas GAIA, Pan-Starrs, and LSST, which will produce massive time-series data.",

For these long-time calculations we use our low Mach number\nhydrodynamics code, MAESTRO, which we have further developed to treat spherical\nstars centered in a three-dimensional Cartesian geometry. The main change\nrequired is a procedure to map the one-dimensional radial base state to and\nfrom the Cartesian grid. Our models recover the dipole structure of the flow\nseen in previous calculations, but our long-time integration shows that the\norientation of the dipole changes with time. Furthermore, we show the\ndevelopment of gravity waves in the outer, stable portion of the star. Finally,\nwe evolve several calculations to the point of ignition and discuss the range\nof ignition radii.",

        "title": "Numerical computation of isotropic Compton scattering",
        "summary": "Compton scattering is involved in many astrophysical situations. It is well\nknown and has been studied in detail for the past fifty years. Exact formulae\nfor the different cross sections are often complex, and essentially asymptotic\nexpressions have been used in the past. Numerical capabilities have now\ndeveloped to a point where they enable the direct use of exact formulae in\nsophisticated codes that deal with all kinds of interactions in plasmas.\nAlthough the numerical computation of the Compton cross section is simple in\nprinciple, its practical evaluation is often prone to accuracy issues. These\ncan be severe in some astrophysical situations but are often not addressed\nproperly. In this paper we investigate numerical issues related to the\ncomputation of the Compton scattering contribution to the time evolution of\ninteracting photon and particle populations. An exact form of the isotropic\nCompton cross section free of numerical cancellations is derived. Its accuracy\nis investigated and compared to other formulae. Then, several methods to solve\nthe kinetic equations using this cross section are studied. The regimes where\nexisting cross sections can be evaluated numerically are given. We find that\nthe cross section derived here allows for accurate and fast numerical\nevaluation for any photon and electron energy. The most efficient way to solve\nthe kinetic equations is a method combining a direct integration of the cross\nsection over the photon and particle distributions and a Fokker-Planck\napproximation. Expressions describing this combination are given.",

An optical tube that appears in the Extensive Landscape\nwith View of the Castle of Mariemont, dated 1608-1612, represents the first\npainting of a telescope whatsoever. We collected some documents showing that\nAlbert VII obtained spyglasses very early directly from Lipperhey or Sacharias\nJanssen. Thus the painting likely reproduces one of the first man-made\ntelescopes ever. Two other instruments appear in two Allegories of Sight made\nin the years 1617 and 1618. These are sophisticated instruments and the\nstructure suggests that they may be keplerian, but this is about two decades\nahead this mounting was in use.",

We show the\nlimitations of standard Fourier power spectral analysis for following the\nevolution of the QPO with time and instead use wavelet analysis and a new\ntime-frequency technique -Matching Pursuit algorithm- to maximise the\nresolution with which we can follow the QPO behaviour. We use the LF QPO seen\nin a very high state of XTE J1550-564 to illustrate these techniques and show\nthat the best description of the QPO is that it is composed of multiple\nindependent oscillations with a distribution of lifetimes but with constant\nfrequency over this duration. This rules out models where there is continual\nfrequency modulation, such as multiple blobs spiralling inwards. Instead it\nfavours models where the QPO is excited by random turbulence in the flow.",

        "summary": "The material that formed the present-day Solar System originated in feeding\nzones in the inner Solar Nebula located at distances within ~20 AU from the\nSun, known as the planet-forming zone. Meteoritic and cometary material contain\nabundant evidence for the presence of a rich and active chemistry in the\nplanet-forming zone during the gas-rich phase of Solar System formation. It is\na natural conjecture that analogs can be found amoung the zoo of protoplanetary\ndisks around nearby young stars. The study of the chemistry and dynamics of\nplanet formation requires: 1) tracers of dense gas at 100-1000 K and 2) imaging\ncapabilities of such tracers with 5-100 (0.5-20 AU) milli-arcsec resolution,\ncorresponding to the planet-forming zone at the distance of the closest\nstar-forming regions. Recognizing that the rich infrared (2-200 micron)\nmolecular spectrum recently discovered to be common in protoplanetary disks\nrepresents such a tracer, we present a new general raytracing code, RADLite,\nthat is optimized for producing infrared line spectra and images from\naxisymmetric structures. RADLite can consistently deal with a wide range of\nvelocity gradients, such as those typical for the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary disks. The code is intended as a backend for chemical and\nexcitation codes, and can rapidly produce spectra of thousands of lines for\ngrids of models for comparison with observations. Such radiative transfer tools\nwill be crucial for constraining both the structure and chemistry of\nplanet-forming regions, including data from current infrared imaging\nspectrometers and extending to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the next\ngeneration of Extremely Large Telescopes, the James Webb Space Telescope and\nbeyond.",

        "summary": "How often do bright optical transients occur on the sky but go unreported? To\nconstrain the bright end of the astronomical transient function, a systematic\nsearch for transients that become bright enough to be noticed by the unaided\neye was conducted using the all-sky monitors of the Night Sky Live network. Two\nfisheye continuous cameras (CONCAMs) operating over three years created a data\nbase that was searched for transients that appeared in time-contiguous CCD\nframes. Although a single candidate transient was found (Nemiroff and Shamir\n2006), the lack of more transients is used here to deduce upper limits to the\ngeneral frequency of bright transients. To be detected, a transient must have\nincreased by over three visual magnitudes to become brighter than visual\nmagnitude 5.5 on the time scale of minutes to years. It is concluded that, on\nthe average, fewer than 0.0040 ($t_{dur} / 60$ seconds) transients with\nduration $t_{dur}$ between minutes and hours, occur anywhere on the sky at any\none time. For transients on the order of months to years, fewer than 160\n($t_{dur} / 1$ year) occur, while for transients on the order of years to\nmillennia, fewer than 50 ($t_{dur}/1$ year)$^2$ occur.",

        "summary": "(Abridged) We present maps for various Galactic longitudes and latitudes at\n1.4 GHz, which is the frequency where deep SKA surveys are proposed. The maps\nare about 1.5 deg in size and have an angular resolution of about 1.6 arcsec.\nWe analyse the maps in terms of their probability density functions (PDFs) and\nstructure functions. Total intensity emission is more smooth in the plane than\nat high latitudes due to the different contributions from the regular and\nrandom magnetic field. The high latitude fields show more extended polarized\nemission and RM structures than those in the plane, where patchy emission\nstructures on very small scales dominate. The RM PDFs in the plane are close to\nGaussians, but clearly deviate from that at high latitudes. The RM structure\nfunctions show smaller amplitudes and steeper slopes towards high latitudes.\nThese results emerge from the fact that much more turbulent cells are passed\nthrough by the line-of-sights in the plane. Although the simulated random\nmagnetic field components distribute in 3D, the magnetic field spectrum\nextracted from the structure functions of RMs conforms to 2D in the plane and\napproaches 3D at high latitudes. This is partly related to the outer scale of\nthe turbulent magnetic field, but mainly to the different lengths of the\nline-of-sights.",

We propose and demonstrate an evolutionary algorithm for\nthe (hyper)parameter estimation of a kernel-based technique in the context of\nan astronomical problem, namely estimating the time delay between two\ngravitationally lensed signals from a distant quasar. Mixed types (integer and\nreal) are used to represent variables within the evolutionary algorithm. We\ntest the algorithm on several artificial data sets, and also on real\nastronomical observations of quasar Q0957+561. By carrying out a statistical\nanalysis of the results we present a detailed comparison of our method with the\nmost popular methods for time delay estimation in astrophysics. Our method\nyields more accurate and more stable time delay estimates: for Q0957+561, we\nobtain 419.6 days for the time delay between images A and B. Our methodology\ncan be readily applied to current state-of-the-art optical monitoring data in\nastronomy, but can also be applied in other disciplines involving similar time\nseries data.",

Angular differential imaging was used in\nthe J and H bands to suppress the speckle noise from GQ Lup A; we show that\nthis approach can provide improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) by a\nfactor of 2 - 6 for companions located at subarcsecond separations. Based on\nhigh quality observations and GAIA synthetic spectra, we estimate the companion\neffective temperature to Teff = 2400 +/- 100 K, its gravity to log g = 4.0 +/-\n0.5, and its luminosity to log(L/L_s) = -2.47 +/- 0.28. Comparisons with the\npredictions of the DUSTY evolutionary tracks allow us to constrain the mass of\nGQ Lup b to 8 - 60 MJup, most likely in the brown dwarf regime. Compared with\nthe spectra published by Seifahrt and collaborators, our spectra of GQ Lup b\nare significantly redder (by 15 - 50%) and do not show important Pa\\beta\nemission. Our spectra are in excellent agreement with the lower S/N spectra\npreviously published by McElwain and collaborators.",

        "summary": "We present the photometric calibration of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS)\nfields. The SNLS aims at measuring the distances to SNe Ia at (0.3<z<1) using\nMegaCam, the 1 deg^2 imager on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The\nuncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates the\nsystematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the dark\nenergy equation of state. The photometric calibration of the SNLS requires\nobtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science field\nstars in each survey band (SDSS-like ugriz bands) with respect to standards\nwith known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the UBVRI\nLandolt standards used to calibrate the nearby SNe from the literature\nnecessary to produce cosmological constraints. The spatial non-uniformities of\nthe imager photometric response are mapped using dithered observations of dense\nstellar fields. Photometric zero-points against Landolt standards are obtained.\nThe linearity of the instrument is studied. We show that the imager filters and\nphotometric response are not uniform and publish correction maps. We present\nmodels of the effective passbands of the instrument as a function of the\nposition on the focal plane. We define a natural magnitude system for MegaCam.\nWe show that the systematics affecting the magnitude-to-flux relations can be\nreduced if we use the spectrophotometric standard star BD +17 4708 instead of\nVega as a fundamental flux standard. We publish ugriz catalogs of tertiary\nstandards for all the SNLS fields.",

        "title": "Large Instrument Development for Radio Astronomy",
        "summary": "This white paper offers cautionary observations about the planning and\ndevelopment of new, large radio astronomy instruments. Complexity is a strong\ncost driver so every effort should be made to assign differing science\nrequirements to different instruments and probably different sites. The appeal\nof shared resources is generally not realized in practice and can often be\ncounterproductive. Instrument optimization is much more difficult with longer\nlists of requirements, and the development process is longer and less\nefficient. More complex instruments are necessarily further behind the\ntechnology state of the art because of longer development times. Including\ntechnology R&D in the construction phase of projects is a growing trend that\nleads to higher risks, cost overruns, schedule delays, and project de-scoping.\nThere are no technology breakthroughs just over the horizon that will suddenly\nbring down the cost of collecting area. Advances come largely through careful\nattention to detail in the adoption of new technology provided by industry and\nthe commercial market. Radio astronomy instrumentation has a very bright\nfuture, but a vigorous long-term R&D program not tied directly to specific\nprojects needs to be restored, fostered, and preserved.",

Algorithms of fringe\nsensing, aimed at fringe parameters identification, are based on\ninterferometric models that have to be carefully adapted to the interfered\nbeams, including variability sources. All information is contained in the\ncollected signals, and how to extract it is subject of researches.\n  In the first part of the thesis, we present the fringe sensing algorithms\nproposed for two different fringe sensors for the ESO VLTI: FINITO and PRIMA\nFSU. We highlight how they must adapt to the different instrumental layouts,\nand we summarize their performance both on simulated and on laboratory data.\n  In the second part, we show the results of the application of some\nstatistical techniques to real interferometric signals. With the time series\nanalysis we examine the composition of signals before and after the\ncombination, separating pure random effects and peculiar features from trends.\nWith the multivariate regression analysis, we are able to isolate noise\ncomponents due to the interference physical process. These techniques can be\nuseful for quality tests both for instrumental performances and for signals\ncharacterization. They could be easily adapted to different interferometric\ninstruments.",

        "summary": "Radio astronomy observations in the coming decade will require new levels of\nsensitivity while mapping large regions of space with much greater efficiency\nthan is achieved with current telescopes. This requires new instrumentation\nwith the greatest achievable sensitivity, dynamic range, and field of view.\nReceiver noise is quickly approaching fundamental limits at most radio\nwavelengths, so significant gains in sensitivity can only be made by increasing\ncollecting area. Jointly, these requirements suggest using large arrays of\nsmaller antennas, or many moderate-size antennas equipped with multi-beam\narrays. The challenge is to develop receivers and wide bandwidth data transport\nsystems which are lower cost, more compact, more reliable, lower weight, and\nmore reproducible than the best current systems, with no compromise to\nperformance. This can be achieved with a greater degree of component\nintegration, extensive use of digital signal processing and transport, and\nreplacement of functions currently performed in bulky waveguide and coaxial\ncable components with digital arithmetic and thin optical fibers. In this white\npaper, we outline the complete redesign and re-optimization of receiver\narchitecture to take advantage of the latest advancements in commercial\ntechnology. This involves the seamless integration of the conversions from RF\nto baseband, from analog to digital, and from copper to fiber within a single\nreceiver module.",

The main goal is to\nestablish a mathematical relation among the set of variables which better\ndescribe the physical characteristics of the host star and the planet itself.\nThe host star is characterized by its distance, age, effective temperature,\nmass, metallicity, radius and magnitude. The exoplanet is described through its\nphysical parameters (radius and mass) and its orbital parameters (distance,\nperiod, eccentricity, inclination and major semiaxis). As a first approach we\nconsider that only the mass of the exoplanet is being determined by the\nphysical properties of its host star. The proposed model is then validated\nthrough statistical analysis. Finally we discuss the categorical behavior of\nthe dependent variable through binary models.",

Radio interferometry\nprovides incomplete and noisy Fourier measurements of the string signal, which\nexhibits sparse or compressible magnitude of the gradient due to the\nKaiser-Stebbins (KS) effect. In this context the versatile framework of\ncompressed sensing naturally applies for solving the corresponding inverse\nproblem.

        "title": "SNANA: A Public Software Package for Supernova Analysis",
        "summary": "We describe a general analysis package for supernova (SN) light curves,\ncalled SNANA, that contains a simulation, light curve fitter, and cosmology\nfitter. The software is designed with the primary goal of using SNe Ia as\ndistance indicators for the determination of cosmological parameters, but it\ncan also be used to study efficiencies for analyses of SN rates, estimate\ncontamination from non-Ia SNe, and optimize future surveys. Several SN models\nare available within the same software architecture, allowing technical\nfeatures such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models,\nand thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and\nimproved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with\narbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several\ncollaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is\nnot intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo\ncontinual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe. Below\nwe give an overview of the SNANA capabilities, as well as some of its\nlimitations. Interested users can find software downloads and more detailed\ninformation from the manuals at http://www.sdss.org/supernova/SNANA.html .",

We show that all correlations for\nsuch a 2D array with an n-level hierarchy can be efficiently computed via a\nFast Fourier Transform in not 2 but 2n dimensions. This can allow major\ncorrelator cost reductions for science applications requiring exquisite\nsensitivity at widely separated angular scales, for example 21cm tomography\n(where short baselines are needed to probe the cosmological signal and long\nbaselines are needed for point source removal), helping enable future 21cm\nexperiments with thousands or millions of cheap dipole-like antennas. Such\nhierarchical grids combine the angular resolution advantage of traditional\narray layouts with the cost advantage of a rectangular Fast Fourier Transform\nTelescope. We also describe an algorithm for how a subclass of hierarchical\narrays can efficiently use rotation synthesis to produce global sky maps with\nminimal noise and a well-characterized synthesized beam.",

        "summary": "We present detailed simulations of the Pan-STARRS-1 (PS1) multi-epoch,\nmulti-band 3-pi Survey in order to assess its potential yield of transiting\nplanets and eclipsing binaries. This survey differs from dedicated transit\nsurveys in that it will cover the entire Northern sky but provide only sparsely\nsampled light curves. Since most eclipses would be detected at only a single\nepoch, the 3-pi Survey will be most sensitive to deep eclipses (> 0.10 mag)\ncaused by Jupiters transiting M dwarfs and eclipsing stellar/substellar\nbinaries. The survey will also provide parallaxes for the ~400,000 stars within\n100 pc which will enable a volume-limited eclipse search, reducing the number\nof astrophysical false positives compared to previous magnitude-limited\nsearches. Using the best available empirical data, we constructed a model of\nthe extended solar neighborhood that includes stars, brown dwarfs, and a\nrealistic binary population. We computed the yield of deeply eclipsing systems\nusing both a semi-analytic and a full Monte Carlo approach. We examined\nstatistical tests for detecting single-epoch eclipses in sparsely sampled data\nand assessed their vulnerability to false positives due to stellar variability.\nAssuming a short-period planet frequency of 0.5% for M dwarfs, our simulations\npredict that about a dozen transiting Jupiters around low-mass stars (M < 0.3\nMsun) within 100 pc are potentially detectable in the PS1 3-pi Survey, along\nwith ~300 low-mass eclipsing binaries (both component masses < 0.5 Msun),\nincluding ~10 eclipsing field brown dwarfs. Extensive follow-up observations\nwould be required to characterize these candidate eclipsing systems, thereby\nenabling comprehensive tests of structural models and novel insights into the\nplanetary architecture of low-mass stars.",

        "title": "A local prescription for the softening length in self-gravitating\n  gaseous discs",
        "summary": "In 2D-simulations of self-gravitating gaseous discs, the potential is often\ncomputed in the framework of \"softened gravity\" initially designed for N-body\ncodes. In this special context, the role of the softening length LAMBDA is\ntwofold: i) to avoid numerical singularities in the integral representation of\nthe potential (i.e., arising when the relative separation vanishes), and ii) to\nacount for stratification of matter in the direction perpendicular to the disc\nmid-plane. So far, most studies have considered LAMBDA as a free parameter and\nvarious values or formulae have been proposed without much mathematical\njustification. In this paper, we demonstrate by means of a rigorous calculus\nthat it is possible to define LAMBDA such that the gravitational potential of a\nflat disc coincides at order zero with that of a geometically thin disc of the\nsame surface density. Our prescription for LAMBDA, valid in the local,\naxisymmetric limit, has the required properties i) and ii). It is mainly an\nanalytical function of the radius and disc thickness, and is sensitive to the\nvertical stratification. For mass density profiles considered (namely, profiles\nexpandable over even powers of the altitude), we find that LAMBDA : i) is\nindependant of the numerical mesh, ii) is always a fraction of the local\nthickness H, iii) goes through a minimum at the singularity (i.e., at null\nseparation), and iv) is such that 0.13 < LAMBDA/H < 0.29 typically (depending\non the separation and on density profile). These results should help us to\nimprove the quality of 2D- and 3D-simulations of gaseous discs in several\nrespects (physical realism, accuracy, and computing time).",

        "summary": "We propose to explore the so-far poorly measured cosmic ray and gamma-ray sky\n(accelerator sky) in the energy range from 10 TeV to 1 EeV. New physics\nquestions might be addressed in this last remaining observation window of\ngamma-ray astronomy. The very high beam-energies provided by Cosmic\naccelerators and the air-shower detection technique naturally imply an\nentanglement between fundamental questions of astroparticle physics and\nparticle physics. The new large-area (10 km$^2$) wide-angle (1 sr) air\nCherenkov detector SCORE (Study for a Cosmic ORigin Explorer) is based on\nnon-imaging Cherenkov light-front sampling with sensitive large-area detector\nmodules of the order of 1 m$^2$. The lateral photon density and arrival-time\ndistribution will be sampled up to large distances from the shower core. The\nphysics motivations, the detector concept and first simulation results will be\npresented.",

We model CTI in the Advanced Camera for Surveys\n(ACS)/Wide Field Channel (WFC) and construct a physically motivated correction\nscheme. This operates on raw data, rather than secondary science products, by\nreturning individual electrons to pixels from which they were unintentionally\ndragged during readout. We apply our correction to images from the HST COSMOS\nsurvey, successfully reducing the CTI trails by a factor of ~30 everywhere in\nthe CCD and at all flux levels. We quantify changes in galaxy photometry,\nastrometry and shape. The remarkable 97% level of correction is more than\nsufficient to enable a (forthcoming) reanalysis of downstream science products,\nand the collection of larger surveys.",

        "summary": "Eulerian hydrodynamical simulations are a powerful and popular tool for\nmodeling fluids in astrophysical systems. In this work, we critically examine\nrecent claims that these methods violate Galilean invariance of the Euler\nequations. We demonstrate that Eulerian hydrodynamics methods do converge to a\nGalilean-invariant solution, provided a well-defined convergent solution\nexists. Specifically, we show that numerical diffusion, resulting from\ndiffusion-like terms in the discretized hydrodynamical equations solved by\nEulerian methods, accounts for the effects previously identified as evidence\nfor the Galilean non-invariance of these methods. These velocity-dependent\ndiffusive terms lead to different results for different bulk velocities when\nthe spatial resolution of the simulation is kept fixed, but their effect\nbecomes negligible as the resolution of the simulation is increased to obtain a\nconverged solution. In particular, we find that Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities\ndevelop properly in realistic Eulerian calculations regardless of the bulk\nvelocity provided the problem is simulated with sufficient resolution (a factor\nof 2-4 increase compared to the case without bulk flows for realistic\nvelocities). Our results reiterate that high-resolution Eulerian methods can\nperform well and obtain a convergent solution, even in the presence of highly\nsupersonic bulk flows.",

In this paper, we present a parallel implementation of the tree\nmethod running on a graphic processor unit (GPU). We successfully run a\nsimulation of structure formation in the universe very efficiently. On our\nsystem, which costs roughly $900, the run with N ~ 2.87x10^6 particles took\n5.79 hours and executed 1.2x10^13 force evaluations in total.

The applicability of the Fourier-disentangling technique for the\ndetermination of pulsation velocities of Cepheids and other pulsating stars is\nstudied. The KOREL-code was modified to enable fitting of free parameters of a\nprescribed line-profile broadening function corresponding to the radial\npulsations of the stellar atmosphere. It was applied to spectra of delta Cep in\nthe H-alpha region observed with the Ondrejov 2-m telescope. The telluric lines\nwere removed using template-constrained disentangling, phase-locked variations\nof line-strengths were measured and the curves of pulsational velocities\nobtained for several spectral lines. It is shown that the amplitude and phase\nof the velocities and line-strength variations depend on the depth of line\nformation and the excitation potential.

        "summary": "The proposed SCORE detector consists of a large array of light collecting\nmodules designed to sample the Cherenkov light front of extensive air showers\nin order to detect high energy gamma-rays. A large spacing of the detector\nstations makes it possible to cover a huge area with a reasonable effort, thus\nachieving a good sensitivity up to energies of about a few 10 PeV. In this\npaper the event reconstruction algorithm for SCORE is presented and used to\nobtain the anticipated performance of the detector in terms of angular\nresolution, energy resolution, shower depth resolution and gamma / hadron\nseparation.",

        "summary": "We describe a Monte Carlo radiative transport code intended for calculating\nspectra of hot, optically thin plasmas in full general relativity. The version\nwe describe here is designed to model hot accretion flows in the Kerr metric\nand therefore incorporates synchrotron emission and absorption, and Compton\nscattering. The code can be readily generalized, however, to account for other\nradiative processes and an arbitrary spacetime. We describe a suite of test\nproblems, and demonstrate the expected $N^{-1/2}$ convergence rate, where $N$\nis the number of Monte Carlo samples. Finally we illustrate the capabilities of\nthe code with a model calculation, a spectrum of the slowly accreting black\nhole Sgr A* based on data provided by a numerical general relativistic MHD\nmodel of the accreting plasma.",

In this paper, a\nsimple method to remove the back ground noise with the use of Zernike\npolynomials is suggested. The images corresponding to individual array points\nof the SHS at the detector, placed at the focal plane are independently\nreconstructed using Zernike polynomials by the calculation of Zernike moments.\nAppropriate thresholding is applied on the images. It is shown with\ncomputational experiments that using Zernike Reconstructor along with usual\nthresholding improves the centroiding accuracy when compared to direct\nthresholding. A study was performed at different Signal to Noise ratio by\nchanging the number of Zernike orders used for reconstruction.

An effective method for\npredicting atmospheric turbulence to reduce servo bandwidth errors in real time\nclosed loop correction systems is presented using data mining.

Partial\ndata is used to predict the subsequent phase screens using the progressive\nprediction method. The evolution of the phase amplitude at individual pixels is\nsegmented by implementing the segmentation algorithms and prediction was made\nusing linear as well as non linear regression. In this method, the data cube is\naugmented with the incoming wave-front sensor data and the newly formed data\ncube is used for further prediction. The statistics of the prediction method is\nstudied under different experimental parameters like segment size,\ndecorrelation timescales of turbulence and segmentation procedure.

This method is based on detection of a\nspecific type of gravitational waves, namely gravitational wave burst with\nmemory (BWM), using pulsar timing. We study the unique signature produced by\nBWM in anomalous pulsar timing residuals. We show that the present day pulsar\ntiming precision allows one to detect BWM due to SMBH mergers from distances up\nto 1 Gpc (for case of equal mass 10^8 Msun SMBH). Improvements in precision of\npulsar timing together with the increase in number of observed pulsars should\neventually lead to detection of a BWM signal due to SMBH merger, thereby making\nthe proposed technique complementary to the capabilities of the planned LISA\nmission.",

This analytic expression of the coupled period-mass\nfunction has been obtained for the first time in this field. Moreover, due to a\nmoderate period-mass correlation, the shapes of mass/period functions vary as a\nfunction of period/mass. These results of mass and period functions give way to\ntwo important implications: (1) the deficit of massive close-in planets is\nconfirmed, and (2) the more massive planets have larger ranges of possible\nsemi-major axes. These interesting statistical results will provide important\nclues into the theories of planetary formation.",

A power-law representation of\ncore-shifts, based on both observations and theoretical considerations of jet\nconditions, is incorporated.\n  Results: It is shown that, in the presence of core-shifts, phase and\ngroup-delay astrometry measurements yield different positions. For a core\ndisplacement from the jet base parametrized by Delta x (lambda) = k lambda^beta\ngroup delays measure a ``reduced'' core-shift of (1-beta) Delta x (lambda). For\nthe astrophysically-significant case of beta = 1, group delays measure no shift\nat all, giving the position of the jet base. At 8.4 GHz an estimated typical\noffset between phase and group-delay positions of ~170 uas is smaller than the\ncurrent ~250 uas precision of group-delay positions of the sources used to\ndefine the ICRF; however, this effect must be taken into account for future\nmeasurements planned with improved accuracy when comparing with optical\npositions of AGN to be obtained with the GAIA mission.",

Here we\nshow that PTAs are also sensitive to mergers of supermassive black holes. While\nthese mergers occur on a timescale too short to be resolvable by a PTA, they\ngenerate a change of metric due to non-linear gravitational-wave memory which\npersists for the duration of the experiment and could be detected. We develop\nthe theory of the single-source detection by PTAs, and derive the sensitivity\nof PTAs to the gravitational-wave memory jumps. We show that mergers of\n$10^8M_{\\odot}$ black holes are $2-\\sigma$-detectable (in a direction,\npolarization, and time-dependent way) out to co-moving distances of $\\sim 1$\nbillion light years. Modern prediction for black-hole merger rates imply\nmarginal to modest chance of an individual jump detection by currently\ndeveloped PTAs.

        "summary": "Millisecond and binary pulsars are the most stable astronomical standards of\nfrequency. They can be applied to solving a number of problems in astronomy and\ntime-keeping metrology including the search for a stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground in the early universe, testing general relativity, and establishing\na new time-scale. The full exploration of pulsar properties requires that\nproper unbiased estimates of spin and orbital parameters of the pulsar be\nobtained. These estimates depend essentially on the random noise components\npresent in pulsar timing residuals. The instrumental white noise has\npredictable statistical properties and makes no harm for interpretation of\ntiming observations, while the astrophysical/geophysical low-frequency noise\ncorrupts them, thus, reducing the quality of tests of general relativity and\ndecreasing the stability of the pulsar time scale.",

        "title": "The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves",
        "summary": "The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav)\nis a consortium of astronomers whose goal is the creation of a galactic scale\ngravitational wave observatory sensitive to gravitational waves in the\nnHz-microHz band. It is just one component of an international collaboration\ninvolving similar organizations of European and Australian astronomers who\nshare the same goal. Gravitational waves, a prediction of Einstein's general\ntheory of relativity, are a phenomenon of dynamical space-time generated by the\nbulk motion of matter, and the dynamics of space-time itself. They are\ndetectable by the small disturbance they cause in the light travel time between\nsome light source and an observer. NANOGrav exploits radio pulsars as both the\nlight (radio) source and the clock against which the light travel time is\nmeasured. In an array of radio pulsars gravitational waves manifest themselves\nas correlated disturbances in the pulse arrival times. The timing precision of\ntoday's best measured pulsars is less than 100 ns. With improved\ninstrumentation and signal-to-noise it is widely believed that the next decade\ncould see a pulsar timing network of 100 pulsars each with better than 100 ns\ntiming precision. Such a pulsar timing array (PTA), observed with a regular\ncadence of days to weeks, would be capable of observing supermassive black hole\nbinaries following galactic mergers, relic radiation from early universe\nphenomena such as cosmic strings, cosmic superstrings, or inflation, and more\ngenerally providing a vantage on the universe whose revolutionary potential has\nnot been seen in the 400 years since Galileo first turned a telescope to the\nheavens.",

Due to high quantum efficiency (93% in the maximum at 550 nm), and\nhigh transmission of its optical elements, the new camera can be used for\ndiffraction-limited (0.02$''$) image reconstruction of $15^{m}$ stars under\ngood seeing conditions.

        "summary": "The relative abundance of deuterium (D) in the solar atmosphere is not known.\nD is not only destroyed in stars, it is also synthesized in the atmospheres of\nactive stars (Prodanovic & Fields 2003). In several cases, production of D in\nthe sun has been detected when solar flares occur, using both energetic\nparticle measurements (Anglin 1975) and by detection of 2.223 MeV gamma rays\nemitted by D (Terekhov et al. 1996; Shih et al. 2009). We describe a project to\nmeasure the abundance of deuterium in the solar wind, and to monitor its\nevolution during a several-year period. The instrument consists of two grids, a\ntritium target, and semiconductor particle detectors. The grids, which are\nhemispherical and concentric, accelerate the incident solar wind ions using a\npotential difference on the order of ~80 to 100 kV and concentrate the ions on\nthe tritium target. A fraction of the solar wind deuterons thus accelerated\ninteract with the target to produce 3.6 MeV alpha particles, some of which are\nrecorded by adjacent semiconductor detectors. A similar instrument was\nsuccessfully tested in space in 1975 in order to observe positive auroral ions\nin a hydrogen aurora.",

It is\ninstalled at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and successfully\nservoed the fringe tracking loop during the initial commissioning phase. Unique\namong interferometric beam combiners, the FSU uses spatial phase modulation in\nbulk optics to retrieve real-time estimates of fringe phase after spatial\nfiltering. A R=20 spectrometer across the K-band makes the retrieval of the\ngroup delay signal possible. The FSU was integrated and aligned at the VLTI in\nsummer 2008. It yields phase and group delay measurements at sampling rates up\nto 2 kHz, which are used to drive the fringe tracking control loop. During the\nfirst commissioning runs, the FSU was used to track the fringes of stars with\nK-band magnitudes as faint as m_K=9.0, using two VLTI Auxiliary Telescopes (AT)\nand baselines of up to 96 m. Fringe tracking using two Very Large Telescope\n(VLT) Unit Telescopes (UT) was demonstrated. During initial commissioning and\ncombining stellar light with two ATs, the FSU showed its ability to improve the\nVLTI sensitivity in K-band by more than one magnitude towards fainter objects,\nwhich is of fundamental importance to achieve the scientific objectives of\nPRIMA.",

        "summary": "The Moon is a unique platform for fundamental astrophysical measurements of\ngravitation, the Sun, and the Universe. Lacking a permanent ionosphere and, on\nthe farside, shielded from terrestrial radio emissions, a radio telescope on\nthe Moon will be an unparalleled heliospheric and astrophysical observatory.\nCrucial stages in particle acceleration near the Sun can be imaged and tracked.\nThe evolution of the Universe before and during the formation of the first\nstars will be traced, yielding high precision cosmological constraints. Lunar\nLaser Ranging of the Earth-Moon distance provides extremely high precision\nconstraints on General Relativity and alternative models of gravity, and also\nreveals details about the interior structure of the Moon. With the aim of\nproviding additional perspective on the Moon as a scientific platform, this\nwhite paper describes key research projects in these areas of astrophysics from\nthe Moon that are being undertaken by the NLSI-funded LUNAR consortium. The\nNASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI) recently funded 7 mostly university-based\nteams to study science of, on, and from the Moon. The LUNAR consortium was\nselected by the NLSI for astrophysical research and education that focuses on\nthe key, unique instruments that most effectively take scientific advantage of\nsites on the lunar surface - low frequency heliophysics and cosmology, and\nlunar laser ranging. We are submitting this white paper to the Planetary\nSciences Decadal Survey to provide additional perspective on the value of Moon\nfor conducting cutting-edge research in astrophysics and gravitational physics\nby describing our key projects for LUNAR. This program of astrophysics from the\nMoon complements as well as takes advantage of expected scientific\ninfrastructure on the Moon during the next few decades.",

        "summary": "In 2006 I published an article in GeminiFocus that examined funding for\nastronomical adaptive optics related technology and instrumentation in the\nUnited States from 1995 through mid-2006. That article concluded that based on\nprojections then current, AO implementation on public and private telescopes in\nthe U.S. will soon seriously lag that on the ESO VLT as measured by funds\navailable. It called for a significant infusion of public funds for AO\ndevelopment and implementation so that when combined with private funds, the\nU.S. astronomical community as a whole would be able to take full advantage of\nAO systems on both public and private telescopes. In 2006 I estimated that the\ntotal amount of public (NSF) funds that would be available in 2009 for AO\nrelated non-science activities would be about $6M.\n  This article updates the analysis done in my previous article. I show that\nfor 2009 the funds for AO related non-science activities are about $7M in spite\nof the termination of the AODP program. Federal stimulus funds (ARRA) to the\nNSF and its grant programs account for a not insignificant part of this $7M. I\nmake the probably optimistic prediction that in 2010 there will be just over\n$6M in NSF funds available for AO related non-science work.\n  Thus there has been no significant real increase of public funding for AO\ndevelopment and implementation since the predictions made in 2006. If private\nfunding in the US and the level of ESO AO funding is close to the values\npredicted in my previous article, then ESO on one observatory, will be\noutspending all US AO efforts spread over about a dozen observatories by a\nfactor of three.",

The first, creating empirical isochrones allows us to\ncreate a robust age ordering, but not to derive actual ages. The second, using\nthe width of the gap in colour-magnitude space between the pre-main-sequence\nand main-sequence (the radiative convective gap) has promise as a distance and\nextinction independent measure of age, but is as yet uncalibrated. Finally we\ndiscuss tau-squared fitting of the main sequence as the stars approach the\nterminus of the main sequence. This method suggests that there is a factor two\ndifference between these \"nuclear\" ages, and more conventional\npre-main-sequence contraction ages.",

        "summary": "We are undertaking an astrometric search for gas giant planets and brown\ndwarfs orbiting nearby low mass dwarf stars with the 2.5-m du Pont telescope at\nthe Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. We have built two specialized\nastrometric cameras, the Carnegie Astrometric Planet Search Cameras (CAPSCam-S\nand CAPSCam-N), using two Teledyne Hawaii-2RG HyViSI arrays, with the cameras'\ndesign having been optimized for high accuracy astrometry of M dwarf stars. We\ndescribe two independent CAPSCam data reduction approaches and present a\ndetailed analysis of the observations to date of one of our target stars, NLTT\n48256. Observations of NLTT 48256 taken since July 2007 with CAPSCam-S imply\nthat astrometric accuracies of around 0.3 milliarcsec per hour are achievable,\nsufficient to detect a Jupiter-mass companion orbiting 1 AU from a late M dwarf\n10 pc away with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 4. We plan to follow about 100\nnearby (primarily within about 10 pc) low mass stars, principally late M, L,\nand T dwarfs, for 10 years or more, in order to detect very low mass companions\nwith orbital periods long enough to permit the existence of habitable,\nEarth-like planets on shorter-period orbits. These stars are generally too\nfaint and red to be included in ground-based Doppler planet surveys, which are\noften optimized for FGK dwarfs. The smaller masses of late M dwarfs also yield\ncorrespondingly larger astrometric signals for a given mass planet. Our search\nwill help to determine whether gas giant planets form primarily by core\naccretion or by disk instability around late M dwarf stars.",

        "summary": "The ambipolar-diffusion theory of star formation predicts the formation of\nfragments in molecular clouds with mass-to-flux ratios greater than that of the\nparent-cloud envelope. By contrast, scenarios of turbulence-induced\nfragmentation do not yield such a robust prediction. Based on this property,\nCrutcher et al. (2009) proposed an observational test that could potentially\ndiscriminate between fragmentation theories. However, the analysis applied to\nthe data severely restricts the discriminative power of the test: the authors\nconclude that they can only constrain what they refer to as the \"idealized\"\nambipolar-diffusion theory that assumes initially straight-parallel magnetic\nfield lines in the parent cloud. We present an original, self-consistent\nanalysis of the same data taking into account the nonuniformity of the magnetic\nfield in the cloud envelopes, which is suggested by the data themselves, and we\ndiscuss important geometrical effects that must be accounted for in using this\ntest. We show quantitatively that the quality of current data does not allow\nfor a strong conclusion about any fragmentation theory. Given the\ndiscriminative potential of the test, we urge for more and better-quality data.",

        "summary": "High-contrast imaging observations of large angular diameter stars enable\ncomplementary science questions to be addressed compared to the baseline goals\nof proposed missions like the Terrestrial Planet Finder-Coronagraph, New\nWorld's Observer, and others. Such targets however present a practical problem\nin that finite stellar size results in unwanted starlight reaching the\ndetector, which degrades contrast. In this paper, we quantify the sensitivity,\nin terms of contrast, of an internally-occulting, space-based coronagraph as a\nfunction of stellar angular diameter, from unresolved dwarfs to the largest\nevolved stars. Our calculations show that an assortment of band-limited image\nmasks can accommodate a diverse set of observations to help maximize mission\nscientific return. We discuss two applications based on the results: the\nspectro-photometric study of planets already discovered with the radial\nvelocity technique to orbit evolved stars, which we elucidate with the example\nof Pollux b, and the direct detection of planets orbiting our closest neighbor,\nAlpha Centauri, whose primary component is on the main-sequence but subtends an\nappreciable angle on the sky. It is recommended that similar trade studies be\nperformed with other promising internal, external, and hybrid occulter designs\nfor comparison, as there is relevance to a host of interesting topics in\nplanetary science and related fields.",

        "summary": "This paper checks on the roles of metallicity and evolutionary age in the\nappearance of the so-called Be phenomenon. Slitless CCD spectra were obtained\ncovering the bulk of the Small Magellanic Cloud. For Halpha line emission twice\nas strong as the ambient continuum, the survey is complete to spectral type\nB2/B3 on the main sequence. About 8120 spectra of 4437 stars were searched for\nemission lines in 84 open clusters. 370 emission-line stars were found, among\nthem at least 231 near the main sequence. For 176 of them, photometry could be\nfound in the OGLE database. For comparison with a higher-metallicity\nenvironment, the Galactic sample of the photometric Halpha survey by McSwain &\nGies (2005) was used. Among early spectral sub-types, Be stars are more\nfrequent by a factor 3-5 in the SMC than in the Galaxy. The distribution with\nspectral type is similar in both galaxies, i.e. not strongly dependent on\nmetallicity. The fraction of Be stars does not seem to vary with local star\ndensity. The Be phenomenon mainly sets in towards the end of the main-sequence\nevolution (this trend may be more pronounced in the SMC); but some Be stars\nalready form with Be-star characteristics. In all probability, the fractional\ncritical angular rotation rate, \\omc, is one of the main parameters governing\nthe occurrence of the Be phenomenon. If the Be character is only acquired\nduring the course of evolution, the key circumstance is the evolution of \\omc,\nwhich not only is dependent on metallicity but differently so for different\nmass ranges.",

        "summary": "Radio pulsars emit regular bursts of radio radiation that propagate through\nthe interstellar medium (ISM), the tenuous gas and plasma between the stars.\nPreviously known dispersive properties of the ISM cause low frequency pulses to\nbe delayed in time with respect to high frequency ones. This effect can be\nexplained by the presence of free electrons in the medium. The ISM also\ncontains neutral hydrogen which has a well known resonance at 1420.4 MHz.\nElectro-magnetic theory predicts that at such a resonance, the induced\ndispersive effects will be drastically different from those of the free\nelectrons. Pulses traveling through a cloud of neutral hydrogen should undergo\n\"anomalous dispersion\", which causes the group velocity of the medium to be\nlarger than the speed of light in vacuum. This superluminal group velocity\ncauses pulses containing frequencies near the resonance to arrive earlier in\ntime with respect to other pulses. Hence, these pulses appear to travel faster\nthan light. This phenomenon is caused by an interplay between the time scales\npresent in the pulse and the time scales present in the medium. Although\ncounter-intuitive, it does not violate the laws of special relativity. Here, we\npresent Arecibo observations of the radio pulsar PSR B1937+21 that show clear\nevidence of anomalous dispersion. Though this effect is known in laboratory\nphysics, this is the first time it has been directly observed in an\nastrophysical context, and it has the potential to be a useful tool for\nstudying the properties of neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy.",

        "title": "Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics IV - Using the Vector Potential",
        "summary": "In this paper we investigate the use of the vector potential as a means of\nmaintaining the divergence constraint in the numerical solution of the\nequations of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) using the Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics (SPH) method. We derive a self-consistent formulation of the\nequations of motion using a variational principle that is constrained by the\nnumerical formulation of both the induction equation and the curl operator used\nto obtain the magnetic field, which guarantees exact and simultaneous\nconservation of momentum, energy and entropy in the numerical scheme. This\nleads to a novel formulation of the MHD force term, unique to the vector\npotential, which differs from previous formulations. We also demonstrate how\ndissipative terms can be correctly formulated for the vector potential such\nthat the contribution to the entropy is positive definite and the total energy\nis conserved.\n  On a standard suite of numerical tests in one, two and three dimensions we\nfind firstly that the consistent formulation of the vector potential equations\nis unstable to the well-known SPH tensile instability, even more so than in the\nstandard Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) formulation where the\nmagnetic field is evolved directly. Furthermore we find that, whilst a hybrid\napproach based on the vector potential evolution equation coupled with a\nstandard force term gives good results for one and two dimensional problems\n(where dAz/dt = 0), such an approach suffers from numerical instability in\nthree dimensions related to the unconstrained evolution of vector potential\ncomponents. We conclude that use of the vector potential is not a viable\napproach for Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics.",

        "summary": "We have measured the speed of both pressure waves and shear waves as a\nfunction of depth between 80 and 500 m depth in South Pole ice with better than\n1% precision. The measurements were made using the South Pole Acoustic Test\nSetup ({SPATS}), an array of transmitters and sensors deployed in the ice at\nSouth Pole Station in order to measure the acoustic properties relevant to\nacoustic detection of astrophysical neutrinos. The transmitters and sensors use\npiezoceramics operating at $\\sim$5-25 kHz. Between 200 m and 500 m depth, the\nmeasured profile is consistent with zero variation of the sound speed with\ndepth, resulting in zero refraction, for both pressure and shear waves. We also\nperformed a complementary study featuring an explosive signal propagating from\n50 to 2250 m depth, from which we determined a value for the pressure wave\nspeed consistent with that determined with the sensors operating at shallower\ndepths and higher frequencies. These results have encouraging implications for\nneutrino astronomy: The negligible refraction of acoustic waves deeper than 200\nm indicates that good neutrino direction and energy reconstruction, as well as\nseparation from background events, could be achieved.",

Using state-of-the-art FPGA based digital Fast\nFourier Transform spectrometers, superior in dynamic range and temporal\nresolution, allows to apply sophisticated radio frequency interferences (RFI)\nmitigation schemes to the survey data.\n  The EBHIS data reduction software includes the RFI mitigation, gain-curve\ncorrection, intensity calibration, stray-radiation correction, gridding, and\nsource detection. We discuss the severe degradation of radio astronomical HI\ndata by RFI signals and the gain in scientific yield when applying modern RFI\nmitigation schemes. For this aim simulations of the galaxy distribution within\nthe local volume (z<0.07) with and without RFI degradation were performed.\nThese simulations, allow us to investigate potential biases and selection\neffects introduced by the data reduction software and the applied source\nparametrization methods.",

        "summary": "The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Experiment is a second-generation\nhighsensitivity gamma-ray and cosmic-ray detector that builds on the experience\nand technology of the Milagro observatory. Like Milagro, HAWC utilizes the\nwater Cherenkov technique to measure extensive air showers. Instead of a pond\nfilled with water (as in Milagro) an array of closely packed water tanks is\nused. The event direction will be reconstructed using the times when the PMTs\nin each tank are triggered. Therefore, the timing calibration will be crucial\nfor reaching an angular resolution as low as 0.25 degrees.We propose to use a\nlaser calibration system, patterned after the calibration system in Milagro.\nLike Milagro, the HAWC optical calibration system will use ~1 ns laser light\npulses. Unlike Milagro, the PMTs are optically isolated and require their own\noptical fiber calibration. For HAWC the laser light pulses will be directed\nthrough a series of optical fan-outs and fibers to illuminate the PMTs in\napproximately one half of the tanks on any given pulse. Time slewing\ncorrections will be made using neutraldensity filters to control the light\nintensity over 4 orders of magnitude. This system is envisioned to run\ncontinuously at a low rate and will be controlled remotely. In this paper, we\npresent the design of the calibration system and first measurements of its\nperformance.",

        "title": "Evidence for a fast evolution of the UV luminosity function beyond\n  redshift 6 from a deep HAWK-I survey of the GOODS-S field",
        "summary": "We perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5<z<7.5, to\nmeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in this\nredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of their\nLuminosity Function. We present here the first results of an ESO Large Program,\nthat exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in the\nnear-IR by the camera Hawk-I at the VLT. We have obtained two Hawk-I pointings\non the GOODS South field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90\narcmin2. The images reach Y=26.7 mags for the two fields. We have used public\nACS images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteria\nZ-Y>1, Y-J<1.5 and Y-K<2. The other public data in the UBVRIJHK bands are used\nto reject possible low redshift interlopers. The output has been compared with\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of our\nselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. We detect 7\nhigh quality candidates in the magnitude range Y=25.5-26.7. This interval\nsamples the critical range for M* at z>6 (M_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). After\naccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidence\nlevel a Luminosity Function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including the\neffects of cosmic variance. For galaxies brighter than M_1500=-19.0 we derive a\nluminosity density rho_UV=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/Hz/Mpc3, implying a\ndecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. On the basis of our findings, we\nmake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,\nbased on ULTRA-VISTA, HST-WFC3 or JWST-NIRCam, evaluating the best\nobservational strategy to maximise their impact.",

        "summary": "The development of Hybrid CMOS Detectors (HCDs) for X-Ray telescope focal\nplanes will place them in con- tention with CCDs on future satellite missions\ndue to their faster frame rates, flexible readout scenarios, lower power\nconsumption, and inherent radiation hardness. CCDs have been used with great\nsuccess on the current generation of X-Ray telescopes (e.g. Chandra, XMM,\nSuzaku, and Swift). However their bucket-brigade read-out architecture, which\ntransfers charge across the chip with discrete component readout electronics,\nresults in clockrate limited readout speeds that cause pileup (saturation) of\nbright sources and an inherent susceptibility to radiation induced displacement\ndamage that limits mission lifetime. In contrast, HCDs read pixels with low\npower, on-chip multiplexer electronics in a random access fashion. Faster frame\nrates achieved with multi-output readout design will allow the next\ngeneration's larger effective area telescopes to observe bright sources free of\npileup. Radiation damaged lattice sites effect a single pixel instead of an\nentire row. Random access, multi-output readout will allow for novel readout\nmodes such as simultaneous bright-source-fast/whole-chip-slow readout. In order\nfor HCDs to be useful as X-Ray detectors, they must show noise and energy\nresolution performance similar to CCDs while retaining advantages inherent to\nHCDs. We will report on readnoise, conversion gain, and energy resolution\nmeasurements of an X-Ray enhanced Teledyne HAWAII-1RG (H1RG) HCD and describe\ntechniques of H1RG data reduction.",

In this paper, we present results\nof a pilot study into the motivations and demographics of Galaxy Zoo\nvolunteers, and define a technique to determine motivations from free responses\nthat can be used in larger multiple-choice surveys with similar populations.\nOur categories form the basis for a future survey, with the goal of determining\nthe prevalence of each motivation.",

A good correspondence is found with the total\nsolar irradiance composite from PMOD/WRC, with no bias between the three\ncycles. The agreement with the other composites (the ACRIM composite, mainly\nbased on the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitors I, II & III, and the\nIRMB composite from the Institut Royal Meteorologique Belgique) is\nsignificantly poorer. In particular, a secular increase in the irradiance\nexhibited by these composites is not present in the reconstructions. Hence any\nsecular trend in total solar irradiance between 1978 and 2003 is not due to\nmagnetic fields at the solar surface.",

        "summary": "Different sequences of ellipsoids are represented on the ellipticity-rotation\nplane. The rotation parameter is defined as the ratio of kinetic energy related\nto the mean tangential equatorial velocity component to kinetic energy related\nto tangential equatorial component velocity dispersion and residual motions.\nSystems with isotropic stress tensor are considered as adjoint configurations\nto their counterparts with anisotropic stress tensor, different angular\nmomentum, and equal remaining parameters. Both nonequilibrium figures and\nfigures elongated by imaginary rotation are represented on the\nellipticity-rotation plane. An application is made to a reduced sample of\nelliptical galaxies. The position on the ellipticity-rotation plane of both\nsample objects and related adjoint configurations with isotropic stress tensor\nis inferred from existing observations within the SAURON project. With a single\nexception, slow rotators are characterized by low ellipticities, low anisotropy\nparameters, and low rotation parameters, while the contrary holds for fast\nrotators. A possible interpretation of slow rotators as nonrotating at all and\nelongated due to negative anisotropy parameters, is exploited. Finally, the\nelliptical side of the Hubble sequence is interpreted as a sequence of\nequilibrium (adjoint) configurations where the ellipticity is an increasing\nfunction of the rotation parameter, slow rotators correspond to early classes\nand fast rotators to late classes. In this view, boundaries are rotationally\ndistorted regardless of angular momentum and stress tensor, where rotation has\nto be intended as due to additional kinetic energy of tangential equatorial\nvelocity components, with respect to spherical configurations with isotropic\nstress tensor.",

        "summary": "The mid- and far-IR spectral ranges are critical windows to characterize the\nphysical and chemical processes that transform the interstellar gas and dust\ninto stars and planets. Sources in the earliest phases of star formation and in\nthe latest stages of stellar evolution release most of their energy at these\nwavelengths. Besides, the mid- and far-IR ranges provide key spectral\ndiagnostics of the gas chemistry (water, light hydrides, organic species ...),\nof the prevailing physical conditions (H2, atomic fine structure lines...), and\nof the dust mineral and ice composition that can not be observed from\nground-based telescopes. With the launch of JAXA's SPICA telescope,\nuninterrupted studies in the mid- and far-IR will be possible since ESA's\nInfrared Space Observatory (1995). In particular, SAFARI will provide full\naccess to the 34-210um waveband through several detector arrays and flexible\nobserving modes (from broadband photometry to medium resolution spectroscopy\nwith R~3,000 at 63um), and reaching very high line sensitivities (~10^-19\nWm^-2, 5sigma-1hr) within a large FOV (~2'x2'). Compared to previous far-IR\ninstruments (ISO/LWS, Akari/FIS, Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS), SAFARI will\nprovide a superior way to obtain fully-sampled spectro-images and continuous\nSEDs of very faint and extended ISM sources in a wavelength domain not\naccessible to JWST or ALMA. The much increased sensitivity of SPICA will allow\nus to step forward and reveal not only the chemical complexity in the local\nISM, but also in the extragalactic ISM routinely.",

The\nstellar reflections appear as out-of-focus images and are not necessarily\naxisymmetric about the star. Using long exposures of very bright stars as\ncalibration images we are able to measure the position, size, and intensity of\nreflections as a function of their position on the field. We also measure the\nextended stellar point-spread function out to one degree. Together this\ninformation can be used to create an empirical model of the excess light from\nbright stars and reduce systematic artifacts in deep surface photometry. We\nthen reduce a set of deep observations of the Virgo cluster with our method to\ndemonstrate its efficacy and to provide a comparison with other strategies for\nremoving scattered light.",

A simple and efficient lab model has\nbeen demonstrated for wavefront correction. The crux of a wavefront correcting\nsystem in an adaptive optics system lies in the speed and the image quality\nthat can be achieved.

        "summary": "Adaptive Optics at mid-IR wavelengths has long been seen as either not\nnecessary or easy. The impact of atmospheric turbulence on the performance of\n8-10 meter class telescopes in the mid-IR is relatively small compared to other\nperformance issues like sky background and telescope emission. Using a\nrelatively low order AO system, Strehl Ratios of larger than 95% have been\nreported on 6-8 meter class telescopes. Going to 30-42 meter class telescopes\nchanges this picture dramatically. High Strehl Ratios require what is currently\nconsidered a high-order AO system. Furthermore, even with a moderate AO system,\nfirst order simulations show that the performance of such a system drops\nsignificantly when not taking into account refractivity effects and atmospheric\ncomposition variations. Reaching Strehl Ratios of over 90% at L, M and N band\nwill require special considerations and will impact the system design and\ncontrol scheme of AO systems for mid-IR on ELTs. In this paper we present an\noverview of the effects that impact the performance of an AO system at mid-IR\nwavelengths on an ELT and simulations on the performance and we will present a\nfirst order system concept of such an AO system for METIS, the mid-IR\ninstrument for the E-ELT.",

This serendipitous\nsurvey contains the deepest mid-IR data taken to date. This dataset is well\nsuited for studies of intermediate redshift galaxy clusters, high redshift\ngalaxies, the first generation of stars, and the lowest mass brown dwarfs,\namong others. This paper provides a summary of the data characteristics and\ncatalog generation from all bands collected to date as well as a discussion of\nphotometric redshifts and initial and expected science results and goals. To\nillustrate the scientific potential of this unique dataset, we also present\nhere IRAC color color diagrams.",

Much of the design\nand analysis of these laser interferometers can be performed using well-known\nclassical optical techniques; however, the complex optical layouts provide a\nnew challenge.

        "summary": "Data volumes from multiple sky surveys have grown from gigabytes into\nterabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into tens (or\nhundreds) of petabytes in the next decade. This exponential growth of new data\nboth enables and challenges effective astronomical research, requiring new\napproaches. Thus far, astronomy has tended to address these challenges in an\ninformal and ad hoc manner, with the necessary special expertise being assigned\nto e-Science or survey science. However, we see an even wider scope and\ntherefore promote a broader vision of this data-driven revolution in\nastronomical research. For astronomy to effectively cope with and reap the\nmaximum scientific return from existing and future large sky surveys,\nfacilities, and data-producing projects, we need our own information science\nspecialists. We therefore recommend the formal creation, recognition, and\nsupport of a major new discipline, which we call Astroinformatics.\nAstroinformatics includes a set of naturally-related specialties including data\norganization, data description, astronomical classification taxonomies,\nastronomical concept ontologies, data mining, machine learning, visualization,\nand astrostatistics. By virtue of its new stature, we propose that astronomy\nnow needs to integrate Astroinformatics as a formal sub-discipline within\nagency funding plans, university departments, research programs, graduate\ntraining, and undergraduate education. Now is the time for the recognition of\nAstroinformatics as an essential methodology of astronomical research. The\nfuture of astronomy depends on it.",

        "summary": "As our capacity to study ever-expanding domains of our science has increased\n(including the time domain, non-electromagnetic phenomena, magnetized plasmas,\nand numerous sky surveys in multiple wavebands with broad spatial coverage and\nunprecedented depths), so have the horizons of our understanding of the\nUniverse been similarly expanding. This expansion is coupled to the exponential\ndata deluge from multiple sky surveys, which have grown from gigabytes into\nterabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into Petabytes\n(even hundreds of Petabytes) in the next decade. With this increased vastness\nof information, there is a growing gap between our awareness of that\ninformation and our understanding of it. Training the next generation in the\nfine art of deriving intelligent understanding from data is needed for the\nsuccess of sciences, communities, projects, agencies, businesses, and\neconomies. This is true for both specialists (scientists) and non-specialists\n(everyone else: the public, educators and students, workforce). Specialists\nmust learn and apply new data science research techniques in order to advance\nour understanding of the Universe. Non-specialists require information literacy\nskills as productive members of the 21st century workforce, integrating\nfoundational skills for lifelong learning in a world increasingly dominated by\ndata.

        "title": "A Parametrization of Cosmic Ray Shower Profiles Based on Shower Width",
        "summary": "Cosmic ray (CR) air showers, detected via the air fluorescence technique, are\nreconstructed in part using functions that parameterize the longitudinal\nprofile of each shower. The profile parameterization yields the position of\nshower maximum, X_max, which is sensitive to the incident CR particle type:\ne.g. p, C/N/O, Fe or photons. The integral of the profile is directly related\nto the shower energy. The Pierre Auger fluorescence reconstruction uses the\nGaisser-Hillas 4-parameter form. The HiRes group has used both the\nGaisser-Hillas form and a 3-parameter Gaussian in Age form. Historically\nanalytic shower theory suggested yet other forms; the best known is a\n3-parameter form popularized by Greisen. Our work now uses the shower full\nwidth half-maximum, \"fwhm\", and shower asymmetry parameter, \"f\", to unify the\nparameterization of all three profile functions. Furthermore shower profiles\nexpressed in terms of the new parameters: (fwhm, f) have correlations greatly\nreduced over Gaisser-Hillas parameters (X_0, lambda). This allows shower\nprofile reconstructions to add constraints (if needed) on the mostly\nuncorrelated parameters (fwhm, f).",

Interpreting formation and evolution of galaxies as a ?transmission\nwith modification' process, we have shown that the concepts and tools of\nphylogenetic systematics can be heuristically transposed to the case of\ngalaxies. This approach, which we call ?astrocladistics', has successfully been\napplied on several samples. Many difficulties still remain, some of them being\nspecific to the nature of both galaxies and their diversification processes,\nsome others being classical in cladistics, like the pertinence of the\ndescriptors in conveying any useful evolutionary information.",

The\ncompressibility properties of spectral lines are analyzed in detail. The\nresults shown in this paper demonstrate that, thanks to the compressibility\nproperties of spectral lines, it is feasible to reconstruct the signals using\nonly a small fraction of the information that is measured nowadays. We\ninvestigate in depth the quality of the reconstruction as a function of the\namount of data measured and the influence of noise.

We therefore\nprovide here a comparison of the pros and cons of observational capabilities\nfrom the ground and from space at optical wavelengths. With an eye towards the\nfuture, we focus on the comparison of a ~30m ground-based telescope with an\n8-16m space-based telescope. We review the current state-of-the-art in AO, and\nsummarize the expected future improvements in image quality, field of view,\ncontrast, and low-wavelength cut-off. We discuss the exciting advances in\nextreme AO for exoplanet studies and explore what the theoretical limitations\nin achievable contrast might be. Our analysis shows that extreme AO techniques\nface both fundamental and technological hurdles to reach the contrast of 1E-10\nnecessary to study an Earth-twin at 10 pc. Based on our assessment of the\ncurrent state-of-the-art, the future technology developments, and the inherent\ndifficulty of observing through a turbulent atmosphere, we conclude that there\nwill continue to be a strong complementarity between observations from the\nground and from space at optical wavelengths in the coming decades.

We include a list of candidate VLBI sites that\nalready support or can be upgraded to support multi-view VLBI located in\nAustralia and overseas, and which have common visibility with ASKAP. The\nresults of our previous \"cluster-cluster\" observations at 1.6 GHz demonstrated\nthe advantages of this configuration to calibrate the ionospheric distortions\nresponsible for the loss of positional accuracy at low frequencies, using\nmultiple calibrators in a range between 1 to 6 degrees away from the target.\nTherefore, we conclude that joint observations of ASKAP with other multi-view\nsites using \"cluster-cluster\" techniques would improve the outcomes of the high\nspatial resolution component of ASKAP applied to astrometric projects,\nachieving higher precision for many more targets, and with lower detection\nthresholds. Also very wide-field VLBI mapping becomes a possibility. Looking to\nthe future, this would contribute to the development of new techniques that are\nrelevant for future high resolution observations with the SKA.",

        "summary": "We discuss a Bayesian approach to the analysis of radial velocities in planet\nsearches. We use a combination of exact and approximate analytic and numerical\ntechniques to efficiently evaluate chi-squared for multiple values of orbital\nparameters, and to carry out the marginalization integrals for a single planet\nincluding the possibility of a long term trend. The result is a robust\nalgorithm that is rapid enough for use in real time analysis that outputs\nconstraints on orbital parameters and false alarm probabilities for the planet\nand long term trend. The constraints on parameters and odds ratio that we\nderive compare well with previous calculations based on Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo methods, and we compare our results with other techniques for estimating\nfalse alarm probabilities and errors in derived orbital parameters. False alarm\nprobabilities from the Bayesian analysis are systematically higher than\nfrequentist false alarm probabilities, due to the different accounting of the\nnumber of trials. We show that upper limits on the velocity amplitude derived\nfor circular orbits are a good estimate of the upper limit on the amplitude of\neccentric orbits for eccentricities less than about 0.5.",

        "summary": "We present Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging of the M8+M8 binary\n2MASS J2206-2047AB. Together with archival HST, Gemini-North, and VLT data, our\nobservations span 8.3 years of the binary's 35 year orbital period, and we\ndetermine a total dynamical mass of 0.15 (+0.05,-0.03) Msun, with the\nuncertainty dominated by the parallax error. Using the measured total mass and\nindividual luminosities, the Tucson and Lyon evolutionary models both give an\nage for the system of 0.4 (+9.6, -0.2) Gyr, which is consistent with its thin\ndisk space motion derived from the Besancon Galactic structure model. Our mass\nmeasurement combined with the Tucson (Lyon) evolutionary models also yields\nprecise effective temperatures, giving 2660+-100 K and 2640+-100K (2550+-100 K\nand 2530+-100 K) for components A and B, respectively. These temperatures are\nin good agreement with estimates for other M8 dwarfs (from the infrared flux\nmethod and the M8 mass benchmark LHS 2397aA), but atmospheric model fitting of\nthe NIR spectrum gives hotter temperatures of 2800+-100 K for both components.\nThis modest discrepancy can be explained by systematic errors in the\natmospheric models or by a slight underestimate of the distance (and thus mass\nand age) of the system. We also find the observed near-infrared colors and\nmagnitudes do not agree with those predicted by the Lyon Dusty models, given\nthe known mass.",

        "summary": "The Gaia satellite is a high-precision astrometry, photometry and\nspectroscopic ESA cornerstone mission, currently scheduled for launch in 2012.\nIts primary science drivers are the composition, formation and evolution of the\nGalaxy. Gaia will achieve its unprecedented positional accuracy requirements\nwith detailed calibration and correction for radiation damage. At L2, protons\ncause displacement damage in the silicon of CCDs. The resulting traps capture\nand emit electrons from passing charge packets in the CCD pixel, distorting the\nimage PSF and biasing its centroid. Microscopic models of Gaia's CCDs are being\ndeveloped to simulate this effect. The key to calculating the probability of an\nelectron being captured by a trap is the 3D electron density within each CCD\npixel. However, this has not been physically modelled for the Gaia CCD pixels.\nIn Seabroke, Holland & Cropper (2008), the first paper of this series, we\nmotivated the need for such specialised 3D device modelling and outlined how\nits future results will fit into Gaia's overall radiation calibration strategy.\nIn this paper, the second of the series, we present our first results using\nSilvaco's physics-based, engineering software: the ATLAS device simulation\nframework. Inputting a doping profile, pixel geometry and materials into ATLAS\nand comparing the results to other simulations reveals that ATLAS has a free\nparameter, fixed oxide charge, that needs to be calibrated. ATLAS is\nsuccessfully benchmarked against other simulations and measurements of a test\ndevice, identifying how to use it to model Gaia pixels and highlighting the\neffect of different doping approximations.",

        "summary": "Independent of established data centers, and partly for my own research, I\nhave been collecting the tabular data from nearly 1500 articles concerned with\nradio sources. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to recover tables\nfrom nearly 600 of these. Tables from only 44 percent of these articles are\navailable in the CDS or CATS catalog collections. This fraction is 62 percent\nfor articles with over 100 sources. Surprisingly, these fractions are not\nbetter for articles published electronically since 2001, perhaps partly due to\nthe fact that often tabular data are published in formats not useful for direct\nmachine reading. The databases Simbad and NED recognize only about 60 percent\nof the bibliographic references corresponding to the existing electronic radio\nsource lists, and the number of objects associated with these references is\nmuch smaller still. Both, object databases like NED and Simbad, as well as\ncatalog browsers (VizieR, CATS) need to be consulted to obtain the most\ncomplete information on radio sources. More human resources at the data centers\nand better collaboration between authors, referees, editors, publishers, and\ndata centers are required to improve the flow of tabular data from journals to\npublic databases. Current efforts within the Virtual Observatory (VO) project,\nto provide retrieval and analysis tools for different types of published and\narchival data stored at various sites, should be balanced by an equal effort to\nrecover and include large amounts of published data not currently available in\nthis way. If human resources can be found, the data sets collected by the\nauthor will be made available for the preparation of metadata necessary for\ntheir ingression into catalog browsers.",

        "title": "Observing Ultra High Energy Cosmic Particles from Space: SEUSO, the\n  Super Extreme Universe Space Observatory Mission",
        "summary": "The experimental search for ultra high energy cosmic messengers, from $E\\sim\n10^{19}$ eV to beyond $E\\sim 10^{20}$ eV, at the very end of the known energy\nspectrum, constitutes an extraordinary opportunity to explore a largely unknown\naspect of our universe. Key scientific goals are the identification of the\nsources of ultra high energy particles, the measurement of their spectra and\nthe study of galactic and local intergalactic magnetic fields. Ultra high\nenergy particles might, also, carry evidence of unknown physics or of exotic\nparticles relics of the early universe. To meet this challenge a significant\nincrease in the integrated exposure is required. This implies a new class of\nexperiments with larger acceptances and good understanding of the systematic\nuncertainties. Space based observatories can reach the instantaneous aperture\nand the integrated exposure necessary to systematically explore the ultra high\nenergy universe. In this paper, after briefly summarising the science case of\nthe mission, we describe the scientific goals and requirements of the SEUSO\nconcept. We then introduce the SEUSO observational approach and describe the\nmain instrument and mission features. We conclude discussing the expected\nperformance of the mission.",

        "title": "Analysis of galaxy SEDs from far-UV to far-IR with CIGALE: Studying a\n  SINGS test sample",
        "summary": "Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from\nfar-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high\nreliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust\nemission at the same time. For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code\nInvestigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston\n(or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on\na modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale & Helou dust\nemission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on\nthe input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and compared\nto the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was\ntested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of\nthe different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting\nexpectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model\ngrid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric\ndata on the code results was estimated. For up to 17 filters between 0.15 and\n160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective\nage of the stellar population at 4000 A, bolometric luminosity, luminosity\nabsorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. A study of the mutual\nrelations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star\nformation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a\nsignificant drop in this activity at about 10^11 M_sol towards higher total\nstellar masses. The dustiest sample galaxies are present in the same mass\nrange. [abridged]",

We have compared XSM observations with\nsimultaneous GOES and RHESSI observations.

The model-independent flux comparison with XSM and GOES data\nat the 1 - 8 angstrom band shows that the fluxes agree with a ratio of 0.94 +/-\n0.09 for the data up to April 2005. The Mewe model-dependent Ts and TEMs differ\nas XSM observes 1.47 +/- 0.03 times higher Ts than GOES and 1.23 +/- 0.08 times\nhigher TEMs and 0.92 +/- 0.05 times lower fluxes. The comparison with RHESSI\ndata at the 6 - 8 keV band shows that the average XSM/RHESSI flux ratio is 2.63\n+/- 0.23. The discrepancies revealed in this study were similar to\ndiscrepancies observed in a number of other spaceborne cross-calibration\nstudies.",

It also poses societal consequences, with our\never-increasing need for accurate space weather forecasts. Solar flares arise\nnaturally as a competition between an input (flux emergence and rearrangement)\nin the photosphere and an output (electrical current build up and resistive\ndissipation) in the corona. Although initially localised, this redistribution\naffects neighbouring regions and an avalanche occurs resulting in large scale\neruptions of plasma, particles, and magnetic field. As flares are powered from\nthe stressed field rooted in the photosphere, a study of the photospheric\nmagnetic complexity can be used to both predict activity and understand the\nphysics of the magnetic field. The magnetic energy spectrum and multifractal\nspectrum are highlighted as two possible approaches to this.",

        "title": "The 14C(n,g) cross section between 10 keV and 1 MeV",
        "summary": "The neutron capture cross section of 14C is of relevance for several\nnucleosynthesis scenarios such as inhomogeneous Big Bang models, neutron\ninduced CNO cycles, and neutrino driven wind models for the r process. The\n14C(n,g) reaction is also important for the validation of the Coulomb\ndissociation method, where the (n,g) cross section can be indirectly obtained\nvia the time-reversed process. So far, the example of 14C is the only case with\nneutrons where both, direct measurement and indirect Coulomb dissociation, have\nbeen applied. Unfortunately, the interpretation is obscured by discrepancies\nbetween several experiments and theory. Therefore, we report on new direct\nmeasurements of the 14C(n,g) reaction with neutron energies ranging from 20 to\n800 keV.",

We describe and categorize existing\ninstruments on 4m and 10m telescopes. Our primary focus is on grating-dispersed\nspectrographs. We discuss how to optimize dispersive elements, such as VPH\ngratings, to achieve adequate spectral resolution, high throughput, and\nefficient data packing to maximize spatial sampling for 3D spectroscopy. We\nreview and compare the various coupling methods that make these spectrographs\n``3D,'' including fibers, lenslets, slicers, and filtered multi-slits. We also\ndescribe Fabry-Perot and spatial-heterodyne interferometers, pointing out their\nadvantages as field-widened systems relative to conventional, grating-dispersed\nspectrographs. We explore the parameter space all these instruments sample,\nhighlighting regimes open for exploitation. Present instruments provide a foil\nfor future development. We give an overview of plans for such future\ninstruments on today's large telescopes, in space, and in the coming era of\nextremely large telescopes. Currently-planned instruments open new domains, but\nalso leave significant areas of parameter space vacant, beckoning further\ndevelopment.",

        "title": "Optical Cross Correlation Filters: An Economical Approach for\n  Identifying SNe Ia and Estimating their Redshifts",
        "summary": "Large photometric surveys of transient phenomena, such as Pan-STARRS and\nLSST, will locate thousands to millions of type Ia supernova candidates per\nyear, a rate prohibitive for acquiring spectroscopy to determine each\ncandidate's type and redshift. In response, we have developed an economical\napproach to identifying SNe Ia and their redshifts using an uncommon type of\noptical filter which has multiple, discontinuous passbands on a single\nsubstrate. Observation of a supernova through a specially designed pair of\nthese `cross-correlation filters' measures the approximate amplitude and phase\nof the cross-correlation between the spectrum and a SN Ia template, a quantity\ntypically used to determine the redshift and type of a high-redshift SN Ia.\nSimulating the use of these filters, we obtain a sample of SNe Ia which is ~98%\npure with individual redshifts measured to 0.01 precision. The advantages of\nthis approach over standard broadband photometric methods are that it is\ninsensitive to reddening, independent of the color data used for subsequent\ndistance determinations which reduces selection or interpretation bias, and\nbecause it makes use of the spectral features its reliability is greater. A\ngreat advantage over long-slit spectroscopy comes from increased throughput,\nenhanced multiplexing and reduced set-up time resulting in a net gain in speed\nof up to ~30 times. This approach is also insensitive to host galaxy\ncontamination. Prototype filters were built and successfully used on Magellan\nwith LDSS-3 to characterize three SNLS candidates. We discuss how these filters\ncan provide critical information for the upcoming photometric supernova\nsurveys.",

        "summary": "Collimated supersonic flows in laboratory experiments behave in a similar\nmanner to astrophysical jets provided that radiation, viscosity, and thermal\nconductivity are unimportant in the laboratory jets, and that the experimental\nand astrophysical jets share similar dimensionless parameters such as the Mach\nnumber and the ratio of the density between the jet and the ambient medium.\nLaboratory jets can be studied for a variety of initial conditions, arbitrary\nviewing angles, and different times, attributes especially helpful for\ninterpreting astronomical images where the viewing angle and initial conditions\nare fixed and the time domain is limited. Experiments are also a powerful way\nto test numerical fluid codes in a parameter range where the codes must perform\nwell. In this paper we combine images from a series of laboratory experiments\nof deflected supersonic jets with numerical simulations and new spectral\nobservations of an astrophysical example, the young stellar jet HH 110. The\nexperiments provide key insights into how deflected jets evolve in 3-D,\nparticularly within working surfaces where multiple subsonic shells and\nfilaments form, and along the interface where shocked jet material penetrates\ninto and destroys the obstacle along its path. The experiments also underscore\nthe importance of the viewing angle in determining what an observer will see.\nThe simulations match the experiments so well that we can use the simulated\nvelocity maps to compare the dynamics in the experiment with those implied by\nthe astronomical spectra. The experiments support a model where the observed\nshock structures in HH 110 form as a result of a pulsed driving source rather\nthan from weak shocks that may arise in the supersonic shear layer between the\nMach disk and bow shock of the jet's working surface.",

        "summary": "Measuring the B modes of the CMB polarization fluctuations would provide very\nstrong constraints on inflation. The main challenge in this measurement is the\ntreatment of systematic effects. CMB observations with imagers and\ninterferometers, subject to very different systematics, are complementary in\nthis respect. Interferometry provides direct access to the Fourier transform of\nthe sky signal. In bolometric interferometry, the interference pattern produced\nby the sky through a few hundred horns is imaged on a bolometer array. Several\nsuch modules are needed to achieve the required sensitivity. We will describe\nQUBIC, a merger of the US and European MBI and BRAIN collaborations. QUBIC is a\npolarized bolometric interferometer to be deployed in 2011-2012.",

This kind of optics that works in\nthe 100 keV - 1.5 MeV band can be used to realize an high-sensitivity and\nhigh-angular resolution telescope (in a narrow field of view). This paper\nreviews the recent progresses that have been done in the development of\nefficient crystals, in the design study and in the modelisation of the answer\nof Laue lenses. Through the example of a new concept of 20 m focal length lens\nfocusing in the 100 keV - 600 keV band, the performance of a telescope based on\na Laue lens is presented. This lens uses the most efficient mosaic crystals in\neach sub-energy range in order to yield the maximum reflectivity. Imaging\ncapabilities are investigated and shows promising results.",

Given an estimate for the point source luminosity function and\nan instrumental point spread function (PSF), a robust upper bound on the\nfractional point source contribution to a diffuse signal can be found. We\nverify with Monte Carlo tests that the statistic has advantages over the\ntwo-point correlation function for this purpose, and derive analytic estimates\nof the statistic's mean and variance as a function of the point source\ncontribution. As a case study, we apply this statistic to recent gamma-ray data\nfrom the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), and demonstrate that at energies\nabove 10 GeV, the contribution of unresolved point sources to the diffuse\nemission is small in the region relevant for study of the WMAP Haze.",

The standard isotropic and\ngravitational-wave radiometer searches (optimal for point sources) are\nrecovered as special limiting cases. The angular distribution can be decomposed\nwith respect to any set of basis functions on the sky, and the single-baseline,\ncross-correlation analysis is easily extended to a network of three or more\ndetectors-that is, to multiple baselines. A spherical harmonic decomposition,\nwhich provides maximum-likelihood estimates of the multipole moments of the\ngravitational-wave sky, is described in detail. We also discuss: (i) the\ncovariance matrix of the estimators and its relationship to the detector\nresponse of a network of interferometers, (ii) a singular-value decomposition\nmethod for regularizing the deconvolution of the detector response from the\nmeasured sky map, (iii) the expected increase in sensitivity obtained by\nincluding multiple baselines, and (iv) the numerical results of this method\nwhen applied to simulated data consisting of both point-like and di#use\nsources. Comparisions between this general method and the standard isotropic\nand radiometer searches are given throughout, to make contact with the existing\nliterature on stochastic background searches.",

These submillimeter power spectra statistically\nquantify the self-similar structure observable over a broad range of scales and\ncan be used to assess the cirrus noise which limits the detection of faint\npoint sources. The advent of submillimeter surveys with the Herschel Space\nObservatory makes the wavelength dependence a matter of interest. We show that\nthe observed relative amplitudes of the power spectra can be related through a\nspectral energy distribution (SED). Fitting a simple modified black body to\nthis SED, we find the dust temperature in Cygnus X to be 19.9 +/- 1.3 K and in\nthe Aquila region 16.9 +/- 0.7 K. Our empirical estimates provide important new\ninsight into the substantial cirrus noise that will be encountered in\nforthcoming observations.",

        "summary": "In this document we layout a new method to achieve \"bona fide\" high precision\nVery-Long-Baseline-Interferometry (VLBI) astrometric measurements of\nfrequency-dependent positions of celestial sources (even) in the high\n(mm-wavelength) frequency range, where conventional phase referencing\ntechniques fail. Our method, dubbed \"Source/Frequency Phase Referencing\" (SFPR)\ncombines fast frequency-switching (or dual-frequency observations) with the\nsource switching of conventional phase referencing techniques. The former is\nused to calibrate the dominant highly unpredictable rapid atmospheric\nfluctuations, which arise from variations of the water vapor content in the\ntroposphere, and ultimately limit the application of conventional phase\nreferencing techniques; the latter compensates the slower time scale remaining\nionospheric/instrumental, non-negligible, phase variations.\n  For cm-VLBI, the SFPR method is equivalent to conventional phase referencing\napplied to the measurement of frequency-dependent source positions changes\n(\"core-shifts\"). For mm-VLBI, the SFPR method stands as the only approach which\nwill provide astrometry. In this memo we layout the scope and basis of our new\nmethod, along with a description of the strategy and a successful demonstration\nof the application of this new astrometric analysis technique to the highest\nfrequency VLBA observations, at 86 GHz. Our previous comparative astrometric\nanalysis of cm-VLBI observations, presented elsewhere, produced equivalent\nresults using both methods.",

The SFPR calibration technique basics and a demonstration of the\nmethod applied to highest frequency VLBA observations are described in detail\nin VLBA Scientific Memo n. 31. Here we outline its importance in the context of\nspace VLBI astrometry with VSOP-2, where errors in the satellite orbit\ndetermination and rapid tropospheric phase fluctuations set extreme challenges\nfor the successful application of conventional phase referencing techniques,\nspecially at the higher frequencies. SFPR is ideally suited for full\ncalibration of those - regardless of the orbit determination accuracy - and, in\ngeneral, of any non-dispersive terms. The requirements for application of SFPR\ntechniques are fully compatible with current technical specifications of\nVSOP-2.

To achieve\nthe required contrast, several coronagraphic concepts -- to remove starlight --\nare under investigation: conventional pupil apodization (CPA), apodized-pupil\nLyot coronagraph (APLC), dual-zone coronagraph (DZC), four-quadrants phase mask\n(FQPM), multi-stages FQPM, annular groove phase mask (AGPM), high order optical\nvortex (OVC), and band-limited coronagraph (BLC). Recent experiment\ndemonstrated the interest of an halftone-dot process -- namely microdots\ntechnique -- to generate the adequate transmission profile of pupil apodizers\nfor CPA, APLC, and DZC concepts. Here, we examine the use of this technique to\nproduce band-limited focal plane masks, and present guidelines for the design.\nAdditionally, we present the first near-IR laboratory results with BLCs that\nconfirm the microdots approach as a suitable technique for ground-based\nobservations.",

        "summary": "The fraction of available telescope time is one of the most important\nrequirements for selecting astronomical sites affecting the performance of\nground based telescopes. A quantitative survey of clouds coverage at La Palma\nand Mt.Graham is presented using both ground and satellite based data. The aim\nof this work is deriving clear nights for the satellite infrared channels and\nverifying the results using ground based observations. At La Palma we found a\nmean percentage of clear nights of 62.6% from ground and 71.9% from satellite.\nTaking into account the fraction of common nights we found a concordance of\n80.7% clear nights from ground and satellite.\n  At Mt.Graham we found a 97% of agreement between Columbine heliograph and\nnight time observing log. From Columbine heliograph and TOMS-OMI satellite we\nfound about 45% of clear nights, while satellite data (GOES, TOMS) are much\nmore dispersed than those ones of La Palma. Setting a statistical threshold we\nretried a comparable seasonal trend between heliograph and satellite.",

        "summary": "Despite the continuing importance of ground-based parallax measurements, few\nactive programs remain. Because new members of the solar neighborhood tend\ntowards later spectral types, infrared parallax programs are particularly\ndesirable. Consequently, the astrometric quality of the new infrared camera,\nFanCam, developed by the Virginia Astronomical Instrumentation Laboratory\n(VAIL) for the 31-in (0.8-m) Tinsley reflector at Fan Mountain Observatory was\nassessed using 68 J-band exposures of an open cluster, NGC 2420, over a range\nof hour angles during 2005. Positions of 16 astrometric evaluation stars were\nmeasured and the repeatability of those positions was evaluated using the mean\nerror in a single observation of unit weight. Overall, a precision of 1.3 +/-\n0.7 microns in x (RA) and 1.3 +/- 0.8 microns in y (Dec) was attained, which\ncorresponds to 0.04\" +/- 0.02\" in each axis. Although greater precision is\nexpected from CCDs in the visual and near-infrared, this instrument can achieve\nprecision similar to that of the ESO NTT infrared parallax program. Therefore,\nmeasuring parallaxes in the infrared would be feasible using this equipment. If\ninitiated, such a program could provide essential distances for brown dwarfs\nand very low mass stars that would contribute significantly to the solar\nneighborhood census.",

        "title": "The variable 6307A emission line in the spectrum of Eta Carinae:\n  blueshifted [S III] 6313A from the interacting winds",
        "summary": "The 6307A emission line in the spectrum of Eta Car (Martin et al. 2006) is\nblue-shifted [S III] 6313A emission originating from the outer wind structures\nof the massive binary system. We realized the identification while analyzing\nmultiple forbidden emission lines not normally seen in the spectra of massive\nstars. The high spatial and moderate spectral resolutions of HST/STIS resolve\nforbidden lines of Fe+, N+, Fe++, S++, Ne++ and Ar++ into spatially and\nvelocity-resolved rope-like features originating from collisionally-excited\nions photo-ionized by UV photons or collisions. While the [Fe II] emission\nextends across a velocity range of +/-500 km/s out to 0.\"7, more highly ionized\nforbidden emissions are systematically blue-shifted (-500 to +200 km/s) and\nextend only to 0.\"4. The [Fe II] defines the outer regions of the massive\nprimary wind. The [N II], [Fe III] emission define the the outer wind\ninteraction regions directly photo-ionized by far-UV radiation. Variations in\nemission of [S III] 9533A, 9071A and 6313A suggest density ranges of 10^6 to\n10^10 cm^-3 for electron temperatures ranging from 8,000 to 13,000K. Mapping\nthe temporal changes of the emission structure at critical phases of the\n5.54-year period will provide important diagnostics of the interacting winds.",

        "title": "A Temperature and Abundance Retrieval Method for Exoplanet Atmospheres",
        "summary": "We present a new method to retrieve molecular abundances and temperature\nprofiles from exoplanet atmosphere photometry and spectroscopy. We run millions\nof 1D atmosphere models in order to cover the large range of allowed parameter\nspace, and present error contours in the atmospheric properties, given the\ndata. In order to run such a large number of models, we have developed a\nparametric pressure-temperature (P-T) profile coupled with line-by-line\nradiative transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy balance, along with\nprescriptions for non-equilibrium molecular composition and energy\nredistribution. We apply our temperature and abundance retrieval method to the\natmospheres of two transiting exoplanets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b, which have\nthe best available Spitzer and HST observations. For HD 189733b, we find\nefficient day-night redistribution of energy in the atmosphere, and molecular\nabundance constraints confirming the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, and CO2. For HD\n209458b, we confirm and constrain the day-side thermal inversion in an average\n1D temperature profile. We also report independent detections of H$_2$O, CO,\nCH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on the dayside of HD 209458b, based on six-channel Spitzer\nphotometry. We report constraints for HD 189733b due to individual data sets\nseparately; a few key observations are variable in different data sets at\nsimilar wavelengths. Moreover, a noticeably strong carbon dioxide absorption in\none data set is significantly weaker in another. We must, therefore,\nacknowledge the strong possibility that the atmosphere is variable, both in its\nenergy redistribution state and in the chemical abundances.",

        "summary": "We present an analysis of timing residual (noise) of 54 pulsars obtained from\n25-m radio telescope at Urumqi Observatory with a time span of 5~8 years,\ndealing with statistics of the Hurst parameter. The majority of these pulsars\nwere selected to have timing noise that look like white noise rather than\nsmooth curves. The results are compared with artificial series of different\nconstant pairwise covariances. Despite the noise like appearance, many timing\nresidual series showed Hurst parameters significantly deviated from that of\nindependent series. We concluded that Hurst parameter may be capable of\ndetecting dependence in timing residual and of distinguishing chaotic behavior\nfrom random processes.",

        "title": "A real-time software backend for the GMRT",
        "summary": "The new era of software signal processing has a large impact on radio\nastronomy instrumentation. Our design and implementation of a 32 antennae, 33\nMHz, dual polarization, fully real-time software backend for the GMRT, using\nonly off-the-shelf components, is an example of this. We have built a\ncorrelator and a beamformer, using PCI-based ADC cards and a Linux cluster of\n48 nodes with dual gigabit inter-node connectivity for real-time data transfer\nrequirements. The highly optimized compute pipeline uses cache efficient,\nmulti-threaded parallel code, with the aid of vectorized processing. This\nbackend allows flexibility in final time and frequency resolutions, and the\nability to implement algorithms for radio frequency interference rejection. Our\napproach has allowed relatively rapid development of a fairly sophisticated and\nflexible backend receiver system for the GMRT, which will greatly enhance the\nproductivity of the telescope. In this paper we describe some of the first\nlights using this software processing pipeline. We believe this is the first\ninstance of such a real-time observatory backend for an intermediate sized\narray like the GMRT.",

        "summary": "The stellar populations of galaxies contain a wealth of detailed information.\n  From the youngest, most massive stars, to almost invisible remnants, the\nhistory of star formation is encoded in the stars that make up a galaxy.\nExtracting some, or all, of this informationhas long been a goal of stellar\npopulation studies. This was achieved in the last couple of decades and it is\nnow a routine task, which forms a crucial ingredient in much of observational\ngalaxy evolution, from our Galaxy out to the most distant systems found. In\nmany of these domains we are now limited not by sample size, but by systematic\nuncertainties and this will increasingly be the case in the future.\n  The aim of this review is to outline the challenges faced by stellar\npopulation studies in the coming decade within the context of upcoming\nobservational facilities. I will highlight the need to better understand the\nnear-IR spectral range and outline the difficulties presented by less well\nunderstood phases of stellar evolution such as thermally pulsing AGB stars,\nhorizontal branch stars and the very first stars. The influence of rotation and\nbinarity on stellar population modeling is also briefly discussed.",

The problem is essentially that of\nrapidly transposing a matrix that is too large to store on one single device;\nin radio interferometry, it occurs because data from each antenna needs to be\nrouted to an array of processors that will each handle a limited portion of the\ndata (a frequency range, say) but requires input from each antenna. We present\na low-cost solution allowing the correlator to transpose its data in real time,\nwithout contending for bandwidth, via a butterfly network requiring neither\nadditional RAM memory nor expensive general-purpose switching hardware. We\ndiscuss possible implementations of this using FPGA, CMOS, analog logic and\noptical technology, and conclude that the corner turner cost can be small even\nfor upcoming massive radio arrays.",

        "summary": "Stellar masses play a crucial role in the exploration of galaxy properties\nand the evolution of the galaxy population. In this paper, we explore the\nminimum possible uncertainties in stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios from the\nassumed star formation history (SFH) and metallicity distribution, with the\ngoals of providing a minimum set of requirements for observational studies. We\nuse a large Monte Carlo library of SFHs to study as a function of galaxy\nspectral type and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) the statistical uncertainties of\nM/L values using either absorption-line data or broad band colors. The accuracy\nof M/L estimates can be significantly improved by using metal-sensitive indices\nin combination with age-sensitive indices, in particular for galaxies with\nintermediate-age or young stellar populations. While M/L accuracy clearly\ndepends on the spectral S/N ratio, there is no significant gain in improving\nthe S/N much above 50/pix and limiting uncertainties of 0.03 dex are reached.\nAssuming that dust is accurately corrected or absent and that the redshift is\nknown, color-based M/L estimates are only slightly more uncertain than\nspectroscopic estimates (at comparable spectroscopic and photometric quality),\nbut are more easily affected by systematic biases. This is the case in\nparticular for galaxies with bursty SFHs (high Hdelta at fixed D4000), the M/L\nof which cannot be constrained any better than 0.15 dex with any indicators\nexplored here. Finally, we explore the effects of the assumed prior\ndistribution in SFHs and metallicity, finding them to be higher for color-based\nestimates.",

Two\ncases provide additional leverage on the present ALMA Level One Science Goals\nand are seen as particularly powerful motivations for building the Band 1\nReceiver suite: (1) detailing the evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks,\nas a complement to the gas kinematics, requires continuum observations out to\n~35 GHz (~9mm); and (2) detecting CO 3-2 line emission from galaxies like the\nMilky Way during the epoch of re-ionization, i.e., 6 < z < 10, also requires\nBand 1 receiver coverage. The range of Band 1 science is wide, however, and\nincludes studies of very small dust grains in the ISM, pulsar wind nebulae,\nradio supernovae, X-ray binaries, the Galactic Center (i.e., Sgr A*), dense\ncloud cores, complex carbon-chain molecules, masers, magnetic fields in the\ndense ISM, jets and outflows from young stars, distant galaxies, and galaxy\nclusters (i.e., the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect). A comparison of ALMA and the\nJansky VLA (JVLA) at the same frequencies of Band 1 finds similar sensitivity\nperformance at 40-50 GHz, with a slight edge for ALMA at higher frequencies\n(e.g., within a factor of 2 for continuum observations). With its larger number\nof instantaneous baselines, however, ALMA Band 1data will have greater fidelity\nthan those from the JVLA at similar frequencies.",

These mount\ntypes may become more widely spread as they have several advantages,\nparticularly for geodetic observatories. Multi-band observations, with multiple\nreceivers, can only be fitted into telescopes with Nasmyth feeds. These are the\nrequirements for the new generation of geodetic arrays as discussed in IVS2010.\nFurther more the next generation of antennae will also be required to have very\nhigh slew rates, and these can be achieved with the E-W mount.\n  The mount type affects the differential phase between the left and the right\nhand circular polarisations (LHC and RHC) for different points on the sky. The\ntarget antennae for the project was the Yebes 40m telescope, but as that was\nstill under construction the data used as a demonstration was from the Pico\nVeleta antenna as part of the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). For the E-W\nmount type there are suitable data from the Australian LBA array. I demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the changes made and that the Nasmyth and E-W corrections\ncan be applied.",

We then\nmodified the well known Gadget-2 code to probe alternative theories of\ngravitation through galactic dynamics. In particular, we modified the Gadget-2\ncode to probe alternatives theories whose weak field limits have a Yukawa-like\ngravitational potential. As a first application of this modified Gadget-2 code\nwe simulate the evolution of elliptical galaxies.

        "summary": "Bolometric Interferometry is a technology currently under development that\nwill be first dedicated to the detection of B-mode polarization fluctuations in\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background. A bolometric interferometer will have to take\nadvantage of the wide spectral detection band of its bolometers in order to be\ncompetitive with imaging experiments. A crucial concern is that interferometers\nare presumed to be importantly affected by a spoiling effect known as bandwidth\nsmearing. In this paper, we investigate how the bandwidth modifies the work\nprinciple of a bolometric interferometer and how it affects its sensitivity to\nthe CMB angular power spectra. We obtain analytical expressions for the\nbroadband visibilities measured by broadband heterodyne and bolometric\ninterferometers. We investigate how the visibilities must be reconstructed in a\nbroadband bolometric interferometer and show that this critically depends on\nhardware properties of the modulation phase shifters. Using an angular power\nspectrum estimator accounting for the bandwidth, we finally calculate the\nsensitivity of a broadband bolometric interferometer. A numerical simulation\nhas been performed and confirms the analytical results. We conclude (i) that\nbroadband bolometric interferometers allow broadband visibilities to be\nreconstructed whatever the kind of phase shifters used and (ii) that for\ndedicated B-mode bolometric interferometers, the sensitivity loss due to\nbandwidth smearing is quite acceptable, even for wideband instruments (a factor\n2 loss for a typical 20% bandwidth experiment).",

        "summary": "Combination of Fresnel Zone Plates (FZP) can make an excellent telescope for\nimaging in X-rays. We present here the results of our experiments with several\npairs of tungsten made Fresnel Zone plates in presence of an X-ray source kept\nat a distance of about 45 feet. The quasi-parallel beam allowed us to study\nsources placed on the axis as well as off the axis of the telescope. We present\ntheoretical study of the fringe patterns produced by the zone plates in\npresence of a quasi-parallel source. We compare the patterns obtained from\nexperiments with those obtained by our Monte-Carlo simulations. The images are\nalso reconstructed by deconvolution from both the patterns. We compare the\nperformance of such a telescope with other X-ray imaging devices used in\nspace-astronomy.",

        "summary": "At present, microlensing light curves from different telescopes and filters\nare photometrically aligned by fitting them to a common model. We present a\nsecond method based on photometry of common field stars. If two spectral\nresponses are similar (or the color of the source is known) then this technique\ncan resolve important ambiguities that frequently arise when predicting the\nfuture course of the event, and that occasionally persist even when the event\nis over. Or if the spectral responses are different, it can be used to derive\nthe color of the source when that is unknown. We present the essential elements\nof this technique and apply it to the case of MOA-2007-BLG-192, an important\nplanetary event for which the system may be a terrestrial planet orbiting a\nbrown dwarf or very low mass star. The refined estimate of the source color\nthat we derive here, V-I=2.36 +- 0.03, will aid in making the estimate of the\nlens mass more precise.",

        "summary": "These notes were originally prepared as additional material for the lessons I\nhave given at the summer school Gamma-ray Astrophysics and Multifrequency: Data\nanalysis and astroparticle problems, organized by the Department of Physics of\nthe University of Perugia (Italy) on July 3-7, 2006. The necessarily limited\ntime of the lessons forced to a drastic selection of the topics and, therefore,\nI have thought it was useful to complete the slides of the presentation with\nthe notes you find in these few pages. These notes are a kind of ``link''\nbetween the theoretical approach of the University lessons and the practice of\nthe real use. During these years, I have seen that this material is useful for\nstudents that are beginning their thesis on research topics based on the use\nand the interpretation of data from X- and gamma-ray satellites. Therefore, I\nhave thought to update the content of these notes, to translate them into\nEnglish and to post on arXiv, in order to make them available to a larger\npublic, hoping to give a useful help to other beginners. Since the public is\nbasically composed of graduating students, I have assumed a well-grounded\nknowledge of basic astrophysics, the principles of instrumentation for physical\nsciences and the statistical analysis. Therefore, I have focused my notes on\nthe practical issues and given some bibliographic references, just some advice,\njust to draw the attention on some points that are too much detailed for a\nuniversity lesson. Nevertheless, the bibliography should be also a good\nstarting point for those who want to further explore these topics.",

        "summary": "We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an\nastronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation\nof that image (the astrometric calibration or WCS information). The system\nrequires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels\nalone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the \"lost in space\" problem\nin which nothing--not even the image scale--is known. After robust source\ndetection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five\nstars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate\nhypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as\ntrue if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a background\nhypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B Catalog and designed for\nuniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is 99.9% for\ncontemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false\npositives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B\nCatalog; augmentation with indices built from the 2MASS Catalog brings the\ncompleteness to 100% with no false positives. We are using this system to\ngenerate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized\nimaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific\ninvestigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it\npossible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary\nprovenance.",

From the shadows we\nreconstruct the images under various circumstances. We discuss physical basis\nof the resolution of the telescope and demonstrate this by our simulations. We\nallow the source to be at a finite distance (diverging beam) as well as at an\ninfinite distance (parallel beam) and show that the resolution is worsened when\nthe source is nearby. By reconstructing the zone plates in a way that both the\nzone plates subtend the same solid angles at the source, we obtain back high\nresolution even for sources at a finite distance. We present simulated results\nfor the observation of the galactic center and show that the sources of varying\nintensities may be reconstructed with accuracy.

We exploit long-exposure images of the Hinode and\nTransition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft to study the\nproperties of faint, episodic, \"blobs\" of plasma that are propelled upward\nalong coronal loops that are rooted in the AR plage. We find that the source\nlocation and characteristic velocities of these episodic upflow events match\nthose expected from recent spectroscopic observations of faint coronal upflows\nthat are associated with upper chromospheric activity, in the form of highly\ndynamic spicules. The analysis presented ties together observations from\ncoronal and chromospheric spectrographs and imagers, providing more evidence of\nthe connection of discrete coronal mass heating and injection events with their\nsource, dynamic spicules, in the chromosphere.",

The data were divided into\nthree arbitrary bandpasses (912-1029 A, 1030-1200 A, and 1235-1450 A) for which\nstellar and nebular flux levels were derived.

        "summary": "The Chandra COSMOS Survey (C-COSMOS) is a large, 1.8 Ms, Chandra program,\nthat covers the central contiguous ~0.92 deg^2 of the COSMOS field. C-COSMOS is\nthe result of a complex tiling, with every position being observed in up to six\noverlapping pointings (four overlapping pointings in most of the central ~0.45\ndeg^2 area with the best exposure, and two overlapping pointings in most of the\nsurrounding area, covering an additional ~0.47 deg^2). Therefore, the full\nexploitation of the C-COSMOS data requires a dedicated and accurate analysis\nfocused on three main issues: 1) maximizing the sensitivity when the PSF\nchanges strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1\narcsec up to ~10 arcsec half power radius); 2) resolving close pairs; and 3)\nobtaining the best source localization and count rate. We present here our\ntreatment of four key analysis items: source detection, localization,\nphotometry, and survey sensitivity. Our final procedure consists of a two step\nprocedure: (1) a wavelet detection algorithm, to find source candidates, (2) a\nmaximum likelihood Point Spread Function fitting algorithm to evaluate the\nsource count rates and the probability that each source candidate is a\nfluctuation of the background. We discuss the main characteristics of this\nprocedure, that was the result of detailed comparisons between different\ndetection algorithms and photometry tools, calibrated with extensive and\ndedicated simulations.",

        "summary": "We present a spectroscopic library of late spectral type stellar templates in\nthe near-IR range 2.15-2.42microns, at R=5300-5900 resolution, oriented to\nsupport stellar kinematics studies in external galaxies, such as the direct\ndetermination of the masses of supermassive black-holes in nearby active (or\nnon-active) galaxies. The combination of high spectral resolution and\nstate-of-the-art instrumentation available in 8-m class telescopes has made the\nanalysis of circumnuclear stellar kinematics using the near-IR CO band heads\none of the most used techniques for such studies, and this library aims to\nprovide the supporting datasets required by the higher spectral resolution and\nlarger spectral coverage currently achieved with modern near-IR spectrographs.\nExamples of the application for kinematical analysis are given for data\nobtained with two Gemini instruments, but the templates can be easily adjusted\nfor use with other near-IR spectrographs at similar or lower resolution. The\nexample datasets are also used to revisit the \"template mismatch\" effect and\nthe dependence of the velocity dispersion values obtained from the fitting\nprocess with the characteristics of the stellar templates. The library is\navailable in electronic form from the Gemini web pages (link above).",

        "summary": "Many astrophysical sources, especially compact accreting sources, show\nstrong, random brightness fluctuations with broad power spectra in addition to\nperiodic or quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) that have narrower spectra. The\nrandom nature of the dominant source of variance greatly complicates the\nprocess of searching for possible weak periodic signals. We have addressed this\nproblem using the tools of Bayesian statistics; in particular using Markov\nchain Monte Carlo techniques to approximate the posterior distribution of model\nparameters, and posterior predictive model checking to assess model fits and\nsearch for periodogram outliers that may represent periodic signals. The\nmethods developed are applied to two example datasets, both long XMM-Newton\nobservations of highly variable Seyfert 1 galaxies: RE J1034+396 and Mrk 766.\nIn both cases a bend (or break) in the power spectrum is evident. In the case\nof RE J1034+396 the previously reported QPO is found but with somewhat weaker\nstatistical significance than reported in previous analyses. The difference is\ndue partly to the improved continuum modelling, better treatment of nuisance\nparameters, and partly to different data selection methods.",

        "title": "FISH: A 3D parallel MHD code for astrophysical applications",
        "summary": "FISH is a fast and simple ideal magneto-hydrodynamics code that scales to ~10\n000 processes for a Cartesian computational domain of ~1000^3 cells. The\nsimplicity of FISH has been achieved by the rigorous application of the\noperator splitting technique, while second order accuracy is maintained by the\nsymmetric ordering of the operators. Between directional sweeps, the\nthree-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always\nperformed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.\nHence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation\nequations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel\nparallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI\nfor cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory. This scheme\nis then combined with an additional OpenMP parallelisation of different sweeps\nthat can take advantage of clusters of shared memory. We document the detailed\nimplementation of a second order TVD advection scheme based on flux\nreconstruction. The magnetic fields are evolved by a constrained transport\nscheme. We show that the subtraction of a simple estimate of the hydrostatic\ngradient from the total gradients can significantly reduce the dissipation of\nthe advection scheme in simulations of gravitationally bound hydrostatic\nobjects. Through its simplicity and efficiency, FISH is as well-suited for\nhydrodynamics classes as for large-scale astrophysical simulations on\nhigh-performance computer clusters. In preparation for the release of a public\nversion, we demonstrate the performance of FISH in a suite of astrophysically\norientated test cases.",

        "title": "On Neutral Absorption and Spectral Evolution in X-ray Binaries",
        "summary": "Current X-ray observatories make it possible to follow the evolution of\ntransient and variable X-ray binaries across a broad range in luminosity and\nsource behavior. In such studies, it can be unclear whether evolution in the\nlow energy portion of the spectrum should be attributed to evolution in the\nsource, or instead to evolution in neutral photoelectric absorption. Dispersive\nspectrometers make it possible to address this problem. We have analyzed a\nsmall but diverse set of X-ray binaries observed with the Chandra High Energy\nTransmission Grating Spectrometer across a range in luminosity and different\nspectral states. The column density in individual photoelectric absorption\nedges remains constant with luminosity, both within and across source spectral\nstates. This finding suggests that absorption in the interstellar medium\nstrongly dominates the neutral column density observed in spectra of X-ray\nbinaries. Consequently, evolution in the low energy spectrum of X-ray binaries\nshould properly be attributed to evolution in the source spectrum. We discuss\nour results in the context of X-ray binary spectroscopy with current and future\nX-ray missions.",

The LNBCs had independent free-running first local oscillators (LO).\nYet, we recovered the correlation by using a radiatively injected common tone\nthat served as the second local oscillator. With this setup, we mapped the\nsurface deviations on a 64 x 64 grid and measured an rms surface deviation of\n~350 um with a measurement accuracy of ~50 um.",

        "summary": "We consider the guaranteed physics of horizontal (hadron) air-showers, HAS,\ndeveloping at high (tens km) altitudes. Their morphology and information traces\nare different from vertical ones. Hundreds of km long HAS are often split by\ngeomagnetic fields in a long (fan-like) showering with a twin spiral tail. The\nhorizontal fan-like airshowers are really tangent and horizontal only at North\nand South poles. At different latitude these showering plane are turned and\ninclined by geomagnetic fields. In particular at magnetic equator such tangent\nhorizontal East-West airshowers are bent and developed into a vertical fan\nair-shower, easily detectable by a vertical array detector (hanging elements by\ngravity). Such \"medusa\" arrays maybe composed by inflated floating balloons\nchains. The light gas float and it acts as an calorimeter for the particles,\nwhile it partially sustains the detector weight. Vertically hanging chains as\nwell as rubber doughnut balloons (whose interior may record Cherenkov lights)\nreveal bundles of crossing electron pairs. Such an array maybe loaded at best\nand cheapest prototype in common balloons tracing upward and tangent hadron\nair-showers from terrestrial atmosphere edge. These array structure may reveal\nthe split shower signature. Better revealing the composition nature. Just\nbeyond the Earth horizons there are exciting, but rarer, sources of upward\nairshowers: the new UHE Tau Air-showers astronomy originated within Earth by\nEeVs tau neutrino signals skimming the soil and forming UHE Tau, decaying later\nin flight. Therefore Horizontal airshowers at equator may show the hadron\nhorizontal twin split nature, its composition as well as a very first expected\nUHE Neutrino astronomy.",

        "summary": "Methyl cyanide is an important trace molecule in star-forming regions. It is\none of the more common molecules used to derive kinetic temperatures in such\nsources. As preparatory work for Herschel, SOFIA, and in particular ALMA we\nwant to improve the rest frequencies of the main as well as minor isotopologs\nof methyl cyanide. The laboratory rotational spectrum of methyl cyanide in\nnatural isotopic composition has been recorded up to 1.63 THz. Transitions with\ngood signal-to-noise ratio could be identified for CH$_3$CN, $^{13}$CH$_3$CN,\nCH$_3^{13}$CN, CH$_3$C$^{15}$N, CH$_2$DCN, and $^{13}$CH$_3^{13}$CN in their\nground vibrational states up to about 1.2 THz. The main isotopic species could\nbe identified even in the highest frequency spectral recordings around 1.6 THz.\nThe highest $J'$ quantum numbers included in the fit are 64 for\n$^{13}$CH$_3^{13}$CN and 89 for the main isotopic species. Greatly improved\nspectroscopic parameters have been obtained by fitting the present data\ntogether with previously reported transition frequencies. The present data will\nbe helpful to identify isotopologs of methyl cyanide in the higher frequency\nbands of instruments such as the recently launched Herschel satellite, the\nupcoming airplane mission SOFIA or the radio telescope array ALMA.",

        "summary": "Eta Car, with its historical outbursts, visible ejecta and massive, variable\nwinds, continues to challenge both observers and modelers. In just the past\nfive years over 100 papers have been published on this fascinating object. We\nnow know it to be a massive binary system with a 5.54-year period. In January\n2009, Eta Car underwent one of its periodic low-states, associated with\nperiastron passage of the two massive stars. This event was monitored by an\nintensive multi-wavelength campaign ranging from gamma-rays to radio. A large\namount of data was collected to test a number of evolving models including 3-D\nmodels of the massive interacting winds. August 2009 was an excellent time for\nobservers and theorists to come together and review the accumulated studies, as\nhave occurred in four meetings since 1998 devoted to Eta Car. Indeed, Eta Car\nbehaved both predictably and unpredictably during this most recent periastron,\nspurring timely discussions. Coincidently, WR140 also passed through periastron\nin early 2009. It, too, is a intensively studied massive interacting binary.\nComparison of its properties, as well as the properties of other massive stars,\nwith those of Eta Car is very instructive. These well-known examples of evolved\nmassive binary systems provide many clues as to the fate of the most massive\nstars. What are the effects of the interacting winds, of individual stellar\nrotation, and of the circumstellar material on what we see as\nhypernovae/supernovae? We hope to learn.",

        "title": "Obtaining supernova directional information using the neutrino matter\n  oscillation pattern",
        "summary": "A nearby core collapse supernova will produce a burst of neutrinos in several\ndetectors worldwide. With reasonably high probability, the Earth will shadow\nthe neutrino flux in one or more detectors. In such a case, for allowed\noscillation parameter scenarios, the observed neutrino energy spectrum will\nbear the signature of oscillations in Earth matter. Because the frequency of\nthe oscillations in energy depends on the pathlength traveled by the neutrinos\nin the Earth, an observed spectrum contains also information about the\ndirection to the supernova. We explore here the possibility of constraining the\nsupernova location using matter oscillation patterns observed in a detector.\nGood energy resolution (typical of scintillator detectors), well known\noscillation parameters, and optimistically large (but conceivable) statistics\nare required. Pointing by this method can be significantly improved using\nmultiple detectors located around the globe. Although it is not competitive\nwith neutrino-electron elastic scattering-based pointing with water Cherenkov\ndetectors, the technique could still be useful.",

        "summary": "Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) used for ground-based\ngamma-ray astronomy at TeV energies use reflectors with areas on the order of\n100m$^2$ as their primary optic. These tessellated reflectors comprise hundreds\nof mirror facets mounted on a space frame to achieve this large area at a\nreasonable cost. To achieve a reflecting surface of sufficient quality one must\nprecisely orient each facet using a procedure known as alignment. We describe\nhere an alignment system which uses a digital (CCD) camera placed at the focus\nof the optical system, facing the reflector. The camera acquires a series of\nimages of the reflector while the telescope scans a grid of points centred on\nthe direction of a bright star. Correctly aligned facets are brightest when the\ntelescope is pointed directly at the star, while mis-aligned facets are\nbrightest when the angle between the star and the telescope pointing direction\nis twice the misalignment angle of the facet. Data from this scan can be used\nto calculate the adjustments required to align each facet. We have constructed\nsuch a system and have tested it on three of the VERITAS IACTs. Using this\nsystem the optical point spread functions of the telescopes have been narrowed\nby more than 30%. We present here a description of the system and results from\ninitial use.",

        "summary": "Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor is a two dimensional array of lenslets which\nis used to detect the incoming phase distorted wavefront through local tilt\nmeasurements made by recording the spot pattern near the focal plane. Wavefront\nreconstruction is performed in two stages - (a) image centroiding to calculate\nlocal slopes, (b) formation of the wavefront shape from local slope\nmeasurement. Centroiding accuracy contributes to most of the wavefront\nreconstruction error in Shack Hartmann sensor based adaptive optics system with\nreadout and background noise. It becomes even more difficult in atmospheric\nadaptive optics case, where scintillation effects may also occur. In this paper\nwe used a denoising technique based on thresholded Zernike reconstructor to\nminimize the effects due to readout and background noise. At low signal to\nnoise ratio, this denoising technique can be improved further by taking the\nadvantage of the shape of the spot. Assuming a Gaussian pattern for individual\nspots, it is shown that the centroiding accuracy can be improved in the\npresence of strong scintillations and background.",

        "summary": "Earth-sized planets around nearby stars are being detected for the first time\nby ground-based radial velocity and space-based transit surveys. This milestone\nis opening the path towards the definition of missions able to directly detect\nthe light from these planets, with the identification of bio-signatures as one\nof the main objectives. In that respect, both ESA and NASA have identified\nnulling interferometry as one of the most promising techniques. The ability to\nstudy distant planets will however depend on exozodiacal dust clouds\nsurrounding the target stars. In this paper, we assess the impact of\nexozodiacal dust clouds on the performance of an infrared nulling\ninterferometer in the Emma X-array configuration. For the nominal mission\narchitecture with 2-m aperture telescopes, we found that point-symmetric\nexozodiacal dust discs about 100 times denser than the solar zodiacal cloud can\nbe tolerated in order to survey at least 150 targets during the mission\nlifetime. Considering modeled resonant structures created by an Earth-like\nplanet orbiting at 1 AU around a Sun-like star, we show that the tolerable dust\ndensity for planet detection goes down to about 15 times the solar zodiacal\ndensity for face-on systems and decreases with the disc inclination. The upper\nlimits on the tolerable exozodiacal dust density derived in this study must be\nconsidered as rather pessimistic, but still give a realistic estimation of the\ntypical sensitivity that we will need to reach on exozodiacal discs in order to\nprepare the scientific programme of future Earth-like planet characterisation\nmissions.",

In particular, investigations of the spectra\ncomponents and states of AGNs and monitoring of variability of sources, study\nof the prompt and afterglow emission of GRBs since the early phases, which will\nhelp to constrain the emission models and finally, help the identification of\nsources in the EXIST hard X-ray survey and the characterization of the\ntransient events detected. SXI will also perform surveys: a scanning survey\nwith sky coverage of about 2pi and limiting flux of 5x10^{-14}cgs plus other\nserendipitous. We give an overview of the SXI scientific performance and also\ndescribe the status of its design emphasizing how it has been derived by the\nscientific requirements.",

        "summary": "Image compression has been a frequent topic of presentations at ADASS.\nCompression is often viewed as just a technique to fit more data into a smaller\nspace. Rather, the packing of data - its \"density\" - affects every facet of\nlocal data handling, long distance data transport, and the end-to-end\nthroughput of workflows. In short, compression is one aspect of proper data\nstructuring. For example, with FITS tile compression the efficient\nrepresentation of data is combined with an expressive logistical paradigm for\nits manipulation.\n  A deeper question remains. Not just how best to represent the data, but which\ndata to represent. CCDs are linear devices. What does this mean? One thing it\ndoes not mean is that the analog-to-digital conversion of pixels must be stored\nusing linear data numbers (DN). An alternative strategy of using non- linear\nrepresentations is presented, with one motivation being to magnify the\nefficiency of numerical compression algorithms such as Rice.",

        "title": "Detecting Changing Polarization Structures in Sagittarius A* with High\n  Frequency VLBI",
        "summary": "Sagittarius A* is the source of near infrared, X-ray, radio, and\n(sub)millimeter emission associated with the supermassive black hole at the\nGalactic Center. In the submillimeter regime, Sgr A* exhibits time-variable\nlinear polarization on timescales corresponding to <10 Schwarzschild radii of\nthe presumed 4 million solar mass black hole. In previous work, we demonstrated\nthe potential for total-intensity (sub)millimeter-wavelength VLBI to detect\ntime-variable -- and periodic -- source structure changes in the Sgr A* black\nhole system using nonimaging analyses. Here we extend this work to include full\npolarimetric VLBI observations. We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter\nVLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion\ndisk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust\nagainst calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization\nfraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of\nchanges in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.\nThe shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures\nthat are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry. The detection of\nperiodic variability in source polarization should not be significantly\naffected even if instrumental polarization terms cannot be calibrated out. As\nmore antennas are included in the (sub)mm-VLBI array, observations with full\npolarization will provide important new diagnostics to help disentangle\nintrinsic source polarization from Faraday rotation effects in the accretion\nand outflow region close to the black hole event horizon.",

        "summary": "We present infrared interferometric imaging of the S-type Mira star Chi\nCygni. The object was observed at four different epochs in 2005-2006 with the\nIOTA optical interferometer (H band). Images show up to 40% variation in the\nstellar diameter, as well as significant changes in the limb darkening and\nstellar inhomogeneities. Model fitting gave precise time-dependent values of\nthe stellar diameter, and reveals presence and displacement of a warm molecular\nlayer. The star radius, corrected for limb darkening, has a mean value of 12.1\nmas and shows a 5.1mas amplitude pulsation. Minimum diameter was observed at\nphase 0.94+/-0.01. Maximum temperature was observed several days later at phase\n1.02+/-0.02. We also show that combining the angular acceleration of the\nmolecular layer with CO (Delta v = 3) radial velocity measurements yields a\n5.9+/-1.5 mas parallax. The constant acceleration of the CO molecules -- during\n80% of the pulsation cycle -- lead us to argument for a free-falling layer. The\nacceleration is compatible with a gravitational field produced by a\n2.1(+1.5/-0.7) solar mass star. This last value is in agreement with\nfundamental mode pulsator models. We foresee increased development of\ntechniques consisting in combining radial velocity with interferometric angular\nmeasurements, ultimately allowing total mapping of the speed, density, and\nposition of the diverse species in pulsation driven atmospheres.",

        "summary": "We present the results of new CCD photometry for the contact binary BX Peg,\nmade during three successive months beginning on September 2008. As do\nhistorical light curves, our observations display an O'Connell effect and the\nNovember data by themselves indicate clear evidence for very short-time\nbrightness disturbance. For these variations, model spots are applied\nseparately to the two data set of Group I (Sep.--Oct.) and Group II (Nov.). The\nformer is described by a single cool spot on the secondary photosphere and the\nlatter by a two-spot model with a cool spot on the cool star and a hot one on\neither star. These are generalized manifestations of the magnetic activity of\nthe binary system. Twenty light-curve timings calculated from Wilson-Devinney\ncode were used for a period study, together with all other minimum epochs. The\ncomplex period changes of BX Peg can be sorted into a secular period decrease\ncaused dominantly by angular momentum loss due to magnetic stellar wind\nbraking, a light-travel-time (LTT) effect due to the orbit of a low-mass third\ncompanion, and a previously unknown short-term oscillation. This last period\nmodulation could be produced either by a second LTT orbit with a period of\nabout 16 yr due to the existence of a fourth body or by the effect of magnetic\nactivity with a cycle length of about 12 yr.",

In particular, the fractional\ndifferentiation can help produce a 'content-matter' based image from a pretty\nastronomical image that can be used for more research and scientific purposes,\nfor instance to reveal faint objects galactic matter, nebulosity, more stars\nand planetary surface detail.",

        "summary": "After more than six and half years in orbit, the ESA space observatory\nINTEGRAL has provided new, exciting results in the soft gamma-ray energy range\n(from a few keV to a few MeV). With the discovery of about 700 hard X-Ray\nsources, it has changed our previous view of a sky composed of peculiar and\n``monster'' sources. The new high energy sky is in fact full of a large variety\nof normal, very energetic emitters, characterized by new accretion and\nacceleration processes (see also IBIS cat4, Bird et al. 2009). If compared to\nprevious IBIS/ISGRI surveys it is clear that there is a continual increase in\nthe rate of discoveries of HMXB and AGN, including a variety of distant QSOs.\nThis is basically due to increased exposure away from the Galactic Plane, while\nthe percentage of sources without an identification has remained constant. At\nthe same time, about one GRB/month is detected and imaged by the two main\ngamma-ray instruments on board: IBIS and SPI. INTEGRAL, after six and half\nyears of observations, has completed the Core Programme phase and is now fully\nopen to the scientific community for Open Time and Key Programme observations,\nwith AO7 recently announced by ESA. In this paper we review the major\nachievements of the INTEGRAL Observatory in the field of Gamma Ray Bursts.",

        "summary": "To explain important properties of extrasolar planetary systems (eg. close-in\nhot Jupiters, resonant planets) an evolutionary scenario which allows for\nradial migration of planets in disks is required. During their formation\nprotoplanets undergo a phase in which they are embedded in the disk and\ninteract gravitationally with it. This planet-disk interaction results in\ntorques (through gravitational forces) acting on the planet that will change\nits angular momentum and result in a radial migration of the planet through the\ndisk. To determine the outcome of this very important process for planet\nformation, dedicated high resolution numerical modeling is required. This\ncontribution focusses on some important aspects of the numerical approach that\nwe found essential for obtaining successful results. We specifically mention\nthe treatment of Coriolis forces, Cartesian grids, and the FARGO method.",

        "title": "Photometric redshift estimation using Gaussian processes",
        "summary": "We present a comparison between Gaussian processes (GPs) and artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) as methods for determining photometric redshifts for\ngalaxies, given training set data. In particular, we compare their degradation\nin performance as the training set size is degraded in ways which might be\ncaused by the observational limitations of spectroscopy. We find that\nperformance with large, complete training sets is very similar, although the\nANN achieves slightly smaller root mean square errors. If the size of the\ntraining set is reduced by random sampling, the RMS errors of both methods\nincrease, but they do so to a lesser extent and in a much smoother manner for\nthe case of GP regression. When training objects are removed at redshifts\n1.3<z<1.7, to simulate the effects of the \"redshift desert\" of optical\nspectroscopy, the GP regression is successful at interpolating across the\nredshift gap, while the ANN suffers from strong bias for test objects in this\nredshift range. Overall, GP regression has attractive properties for\nphotometric redshift estimation, particularly for deep, high-redshift surveys\nwhere it is difficult to obtain a large, complete training set. At present,\nunlike the ANN code, public GP regression codes do not take account of\ninhomogeneous measurement errors on the photometric data, and thus cannot\nestimate reliable uncertainties on the predicted redshifts. However, a better\ntreatment of errors is in principle possible, and the promising results in this\npaper suggest that such improved GP algorithms should be pursued. (abridged)",

The\nRVs were computed using our novel iodine cell technique for double-line binary\nstars. The precision of the RVs is of the order of 1-10 m/s. Our RVs combined\nwith the archival visibility measurements from the Palomar Testbed\nInterferometer allow us to derive very precise spectroscopic/astrometric\norbital and physical parameters of the binaries. In particular, we derive the\nmasses, the absolute K and H band magnitudes and the parallaxes. The masses\ntogether with the absolute magnitudes in the K and H bands enable us to\nestimate the ages of the binaries.\n  These RVs allow us to obtain some of the most accurate mass determinations of\nbinary stars. The fractional accuracy in m*sin(i) only and hence based on the\nRVs alone ranges from 0.02% to 0.42%. When combined with the PTI astrometry,\nthe fractional accuracy in the masses ranges in the three best cases from 0.06%\nto 0.5%. Among them, the masses of HD210027 components rival in precision the\nmass determination of the components of the relativistic double pulsar system\nPSRJ0737-3039. In the near future, for double-lined eclipsing binary stars we\nexpect to derive masses with a fractional accuracy of the order of up to\n~0.001% with our technique. This level of precision is an order of magnitude\nhigher than of the most accurate mass determination for a body outside the\nSolar System - the double neutron star system PSRB1913+16.",

        "summary": "We investigate data compression schemes for proposed all-sky\ndiffraction-limited visible/NIR sky surveys aimed at the dark energy problem.\nWe show that lossy square-root compression to 1 bit of noise per pixel,\nfollowed by standard lossless compression algorithms, reduces the images to\n2.5-4 bits per pixel, depending primarily upon the level of cosmic-ray\ncontamination of the images. Compression to this level adds noise equivalent to\n<10% penalty in observing time. We derive an analytic correction to flux biases\ninherent to the square-root compression scheme. Numerical tests on simple\ngalaxy models confirm that galaxy fluxes and shapes are measured with\nsystematic biases <~10^{-4} induced by the compression scheme, well below the\nrequirements of supernova and weak gravitational lensing dark-energy\nexperiments. An accompanying paper (Vanderveld 2009) bounds the shape biases\nusing realistic simulated images of the high-Galactic-latitude sky. The\nsquare-root preprocessing step has advantages over simple (linear) decimation\nwhen there are many bright objects or cosmic rays in the field, or when the\nbackground level will vary.",

        "summary": "We present a semi-analytical method to investigate the systematic effects and\nstatistical uncertainties of the calculated angular power spectrum when\nincomplete spherical maps are used. The computed power spectrum suffers in\nparticular a loss of angular frequency resolution, which can be written as\n\\delta_l ~ \\pi/\\gamma_max, where \\gamma_max is the effective maximum extent of\nthe partial spherical maps. We propose a correction algorithm to reduce\nsystematic effects on the estimated C_l, as obtained from the partial map\nprojection on the spherical harmonic Ylm(l,m) basis. We have derived near\noptimal bands and weighting functions in l-space for power spectrum calculation\nusing small maps, and a correction algorithm for partially masked spherical\nmaps that contain information on the angular correlations on all scales.",

        "title": "Platform Deformation Refined Pointing and Phase Correction for the AMiBA\n  Hexapod Telescope",
        "summary": "The Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA) is a radio\ninterferometer for research in cosmology, currently operating 7 0.6m diameter\nantennas co-mounted on a 6m diameter platform driven by a hexapod mount. AMiBA\nis currently the largest hexapod telescope. We briefly summarize the hexapod\noperation with the current pointing error model. We then focus on the upcoming\n13-element expansion with its potential difficulties and solutions.\nPhotogrammetry measurements of the platform reveal deformations at a level\nwhich can affect the optical pointing and the receiver radio phase. In order to\nprepare for the 13-element upgrade, two optical telescopes are installed on the\nplatform to correlate optical pointing tests. Being mounted on different\nlocations, the residuals of the two sets of pointing errors show a\ncharacteristic phase and amplitude difference as a function of the platform\ndeformation pattern. These results depend on the telescope's azimuth, elevation\nand polarization position. An analytical model for the deformation is derived\nin order to separate the local deformation induced error from the real hexapod\npointing error. Similarly, we demonstrate that the deformation induced radio\nphase error can be reliably modeled and calibrated, which allows us to recover\nthe ideal synthesized beam in amplitude and shape of up to 90% or more. The\nresulting array efficiency and its limits are discussed based on the derived\nerrors.",

Out of 536 single mode RR Lyrae stars\nselected from the database, we have investigated the physical properties of 335\n`normal looking' RRab stars and 17 RRc stars that have good quality photometric\nlight curves. We have also been able to estimate the distance modulus of the\ncloud which is in good agreement with those determined from other independent\nmethods. The Fourier decomposition method has been used to study the basic\nproperties of these variables. Accurate Fourier decomposition parameters of 536\nRR Lyrae stars in the OGLE-II database are computed. Empirical relations\nbetween the Fourier parameters and some physical parameters of these variables\nhave been used to estimate the physical parameters for the stars from the\nFourier analysis. Further, the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of the\nSMC RR Lyrae stars yields their mean physical parameters as: [Fe/H] = -1.56\n$\\pm 0.25$, M = 0.55 $\\pm $ 0.01 M$_{\\odot}$, T$_{\\rm eff} = 6404 \\pm 12$ K,\n$\\log \\rm L = 1.60 \\pm0.01 \\rm L_\\odot$ and M$\\rm_V = 0.78 \\pm0.02 $ for 335\nRRab variables and [Fe/H] = -1.90 $\\pm$ 0.13, M = 0.82 $\\pm $ 0.18 M$_{\\odot}$,\nT$_{\\rm eff} = 7177 \\pm 16$ K, $\\log \\rm L = 1.62 \\pm 0.02 \\rm L_{\\odot}$ and\nM$\\rm_V = 0.76 \\pm 0.05$ for 17 RRc stars.",

It is an imaging experiment based on a set of four\nindependent silicon strip detectors, equipped with one-dimensional coded masks,\noperating in the nominal energy range 18-60 keV. The main goal of SuperAGILE is\nthe observation of cosmic sources simultaneously with the main gamma-ray AGILE\nexperiment, the Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID). Given its\n$\\sim$steradian-wide field of view and its $\\sim$15 mCrab day-sensitivity,\nSuperAGILE is also well suited for the long-term monitoring of Galactic compact\nobjects and the detection of bright transients. The SuperAGILE detector\nproperties and design allow for a 6 arcmin angular resolution in each of the\ntwo independent orthogonal projections of the celestial coordinates. Photon by\nphoton data are continuously available by the experiment telemetry, and are\nused to derive images and fluxes of individual sources, with integration times\ndepending on the source intensity and position in the field of view. In this\npaper we report on the main scientific results achieved by SuperAGILE over its\nfirst two years in orbit, until April 2009.",

        "summary": "We report on the method developed by Zibetti, Charlot and Rix (2009) to\nconstruct resolved stellar mass maps of galaxies from optical and NIR imaging.\nAccurate pixel-by-pixel colour information (specifically g-i and i-H) is\nconverted into stellar mass-to-light ratios with typical accuracy of 30%, based\non median likelihoods derived from a Monte Carlo library of 50,000 stellar\npopulation synthesis models that include dust and updated TP-AGB phase\nprescriptions. Hence, surface mass densities are computed. In a pilot study, we\nanalyze 9 galaxies spanning a broad range of morphologies. Among the main\nresults, we find that: i) galaxies appear much smoother in stellar mass maps\nthan at any optical or NIR wavelength; ii) total stellar mass estimates based\non unresolved photometry are biased low with respect to the integral of\nresolved stellar mass maps, by up to 40%, due to dust obscured regions being\nunder-represented in global colours; iii) within a galaxy, on local scales\ncolours correlate with surface stellar mass density; iv) the slope and\ntightness of this correlation reflect/depend on the morphology of the galaxy.",

        "summary": "Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust standard ruler with which\nto measure the acceleration of the Universe. The BAO feature has so far been\ndetected in optical galaxy surveys. Intensity mapping of neutral hydrogen\nemission with a ground-based radio telescope provides another promising window\nfor measuring BAO at redshifts of order unity for relatively low cost. While\nthe cylindrical radio telescope (CRT) proposed for these measurements will have\nexcellent redshift resolution, it will suffer from poor angular resolution (a\nfew arcminutes at best). We investigate the effect of angular resolution on the\nstandard ruler test with BAO, using the Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit\nas a benchmark. We then extend the analysis to include variations in the\nparameters characterizing the telescope and the underlying physics. Finally, we\noptimize the survey parameters (holding total cost fixed) and present an\nexample of a CRT BAO survey that is competitive with Stage III dark energy\nexperiments. The tools developed here form the backbone of a publicly available\ncode that can be used to obtain estimates of cost and Figure of Merit for any\nset of parameters.",

        "summary": "In this article we identify and discuss various statistical and systematic\neffects influencing the astrometric accuracy achievable with MICADO, the\nnear-infrared imaging camera proposed for the 42-metre European Extremely Large\nTelescope (E-ELT). These effects are instrumental (e.g. geometric distortion),\natmospheric (e.g. chromatic differential refraction), and astronomical\n(reference source selection). We find that there are several phenomena having\nimpact on ~100 micro-arcsec scales, meaning they can be substantially larger\nthan the theoretical statistical astrometric accuracy of an optical/NIR\n42m-telescope. Depending on type, these effects need to be controlled via\ndedicated instrumental design properties or via dedicated calibration\nprocedures. We conclude that if this is done properly, astrometric accuracies\nof 40 micro-arcsec or better - with 40 micro-arcsec/year in proper motions\ncorresponding to ~20 km/s at 100 kpc distance - can be achieved in one epoch of\nactual observations",

        "title": "Ubiquitous High Speed Transition Region and Coronal Upflows in the Quiet\n  Sun",
        "summary": "We study the line profiles of a range of transition region (TR) emission\nlines observed in typical quiet Sun regions. In magnetic network regions, the\nSi IV 1402\\AA{}, C IV 1548\\AA{}, N V 1238\\AA{}, O VI 1031\\AA{}, and Ne VIII\n770\\AA{} spectral lines show significant asymmetry in the blue wing of the\nemission line profiles. We interpret these high-velocity upflows in the lower\nand upper TR as the quiet Sun equivalent of the recently discovered upflows in\nthe low corona above plage regions (Hara et al., 2008). The latter have been\nshown to be directly associated with high-velocity chromospheric spicules that\nare (partially) heated to coronal temperatures and play a significant role in\nsupplying the active region corona with hot plasma (DePontieu et al., 2009}. We\nshow that a similar process likely dominates the quiet Sun network. We provide\na new interpretation of the observed quiet Sun TR emission in terms of the\nrelentless mass transport between the chromosphere and corona - a mixture of\nemission from dynamic episodic heating and mass injection into the corona as\nwell as that from the previously filled, slowly cooling, coronal plasma.\nAnalysis of the observed upflow component shows that it carries enough hot\nplasma to play a significant role in the energy and mass balance of the quiet\ncorona. We determine the temperature dependence of the upflow velocities to\nconstrain the acceleration and heating mechanism that drives these upflows. We\nalso show that the temporal characteristics of these upflows suggest an\nepisodic driver that sometimes leads to quasi-periodic signals. We suggest that\nat least some of the quasi-periodicities observed with coronal imagers and\nspectrographs that have previously been interpreted as propagating\nmagnetoacoustic waves, may instead be caused by these upflows.",

The wearable-computer platform has been\ntested at geological and astrobiological field sites in Spain (Rivas\nVaciamadrid and Riba de Santiuste), and the phone-camera has been tested at a\ngeological field site in Malta. In this work, we (i) apply a Hopfield\nneural-network algorithm for novelty detection based upon color, (ii) integrate\na field-capable digital microscope on the wearable computer platform, (iii)\ntest this novelty detection with the digital microscope at Rivas Vaciamadrid,\n(iv) develop a Bluetooth communication mode for the phone-camera platform, in\norder to allow access to a mobile processing computer at the field sites, and\n(v) test the novelty detection on the Bluetooth-enabled phone-camera connected\nto a netbook computer at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. This systems\nengineering and field testing have together allowed us to develop a real-time\ncomputer-vision system that is capable, for example, of identifying lichens as\nnovel within a series of images acquired in semi-arid desert environments. We\nacquired sequences of images of geologic outcrops in Utah and Spain consisting\nof various rock types and colors to test this algorithm. The algorithm robustly\nrecognized previously-observed units by their color, while requiring only a\nsingle image or a few images to learn colors as familiar, demonstrating its\nfast learning capability.",

        "title": "Straight to the Source: Detecting Aggregate Objects in Astronomical\n  Images with Proper Error Control",
        "summary": "The next generation of telescopes will acquire terabytes of image data on a\nnightly basis. Collectively, these large images will contain billions of\ninteresting objects, which astronomers call sources. The astronomers' task is\nto construct a catalog detailing the coordinates and other properties of the\nsources. The source catalog is the primary data product for most telescopes and\nis an important input for testing new astrophysical theories, but to construct\nthe catalog one must first detect the sources. Existing algorithms for catalog\ncreation are effective at detecting sources, but do not have rigorous\nstatistical error control. At the same time, there are several multiple testing\nprocedures that provide rigorous error control, but they are not designed to\ndetect sources that are aggregated over several pixels. In this paper, we\npropose a technique that does both, by providing rigorous statistical error\ncontrol on the aggregate objects themselves rather than the pixels. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data from the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory Satellite. Our technique effectively controls the rate of false\nsources, yet still detects almost all of the sources detected by procedures\nthat do not have such rigorous error control and have the advantage of\nadditional data in the form of follow up observations, which will not be\navailable for upcoming large telescopes. In fact, we even detect a new source\nthat was missed by previous studies. The statistical methods developed in this\npaper can be extended to problems beyond Astronomy, as we will illustrate with\nan example from Neuroimaging.",

        "summary": "When scientific experiments require transmission of powerful laser or radio\nbeams through the atmosphere the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires\nthat precautions be taken to avoid inadvertent illumination of aircraft. Here\nwe describe a highly reliable system for detecting aircraft entering the\nvicinity of a laser beam by making use of the Air Traffic Control (ATC)\ntransponders required on most aircraft. This system uses two antennas, both\naligned with the laser beam. One antenna has a broad beam and the other has a\nnarrow beam. The ratio of the transponder power received in the narrow beam to\nthat received in the broad beam gives a measure of the angular distance of the\naircraft from the axis that is independent of the range or the transmitter\npower. This ratio is easily measured and can be used to shutter the laser when\nthe aircraft is too close to the beam. Prototype systems operating on\nastronomical telescopes have produced good results.",

        "title": "UHE neutrino searches using a Lunar target: First Results from the RESUN\n  search",
        "summary": "During the past decade there have been several attempts to detect cosmogenic\nultra high energy (UHE) neutrinos by searching for radio Cerenkov bursts\nresulting from charged impact showers in terrestrial ice or the lunar regolith.\nSo far these radio searches have yielded no detections, but the inferred flux\nupper limits have started to constrain physical models for UHE neutrino\ngeneration. For searches which use the Moon as a target, we summarize the\nphysics of the interaction, properties of the resulting Cerenkov radio pulse,\ndetection statistics, effective aperture scaling laws, and derivation of upper\nlimits for isotropic and point source models. We report on initial results from\nthe RESUN search, which uses the Expanded Very Large Array configured in\nmultiple sub-arrays of four antennas at 1.45 GHz pointing along the lunar limb.\nWe detected no pulses of lunar origin during 45 observing hours. This implies\nupper limits to the differential neutrino flux E^2 dN/dE < 0.003 EeV km^{-2}\ns^{-1} sr^{-1} and < 0.0003 EeV km$^{-2} s^{-1} at 90% confidence level for\nisotropic and sampled point sources respectively, in the neutrino energy range\n10^{21.6} < E(eV) < 10^{22.6}. The isotropic flux limit is comparable to the\nlowest published upper limits for lunar searches. The full RESUN search, with\nan additional 200 hours observing time and an improved data acquisition scheme,\nwill be be an order of magnitude more sensitive in the energy range 10^{21} <\nE(eV) < 10^{22} than previous lunar-target searches, and will test Z burst\nmodels of neutrino generation.",

We introduce a simple\nmethod for continuation of the observed complex polarized intensity into this\ndomain using symmetry arguments. The method is suggested in context of magnetic\nfield recognition in galactic disks where the magnetic field is supposed to\nhave a maximum in the equatorial plane. The method is quite simple when applied\nto a single Faraday-rotating structure on the line of sight. Recognition of\nseveral structures on the same line of sight requires a more sophisticated\ntechnique. We also introduce a wavelet-based algorithm which allows us to\nconsider a set of isolated structures. The method essentially improves the\npossibilities for reconstruction of complicated Faraday structures using the\ncapabilities of modern radio telescopes.",

In this paper we present the first system test in which we\ndemonstrate the concept of using an array of Distributed Read Out Imaging\nDevices (DROIDs) for optical photon detection. Aims. After the successful S-Cam\n3 detector the next step in the development of a cryogenic optical photon\ncounting imaging spectrometer under the S-Cam project is to increase the field\nof view using DROIDs. With this modification the field of view of the camera\nhas been increased by a factor of 5 in area, while keeping the number of\nreadout channels the same. Methods. The test has been performed using the\nflexible S-Cam 3 system and exchanging the 10x12 Superconducting Tunnel\nJunction array for a 3x20 DROID array. The extra data reduction needed with\nDROIDs is performed offline. Results. We show that, although the responsivity\n(number of tunnelled quasiparticles per unit of absorbed photon energy, e- /eV)\nof the current array is too low for direct astronomical applications, the\nimaging quality is already good enough for pattern detection, and will improve\nfurther with increasing responsivity. Conclusions. The obtained knowledge can\nbe used to optimise the system for the use of DROIDs.",

        "summary": "We describe the application of data mining algorithms to research problems in\nastronomy. We posit that data mining has always been fundamental to\nastronomical research, since data mining is the basis of evidence-based\ndiscovery, including classification, clustering, and novelty discovery. These\nalgorithms represent a major set of computational tools for discovery in large\ndatabases, which will be increasingly essential in the era of data-intensive\nastronomy. Historical examples of data mining in astronomy are reviewed,\nfollowed by a discussion of one of the largest data-producing projects\nanticipated for the coming decade: the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).\nTo facilitate data-driven discoveries in astronomy, we envision a new\ndata-oriented research paradigm for astronomy and astrophysics --\nastroinformatics. Astroinformatics is described as both a research approach and\nan educational imperative for modern data-intensive astronomy. An important\napplication area for large time-domain sky surveys (such as LSST) is the rapid\nidentification, characterization, and classification of real-time sky events\n(including moving objects, photometrically variable objects, and the appearance\nof transients). We describe one possible implementation of a classification\nbroker for such events, which incorporates several astroinformatics techniques:\nuser annotation, semantic tagging, metadata markup, heterogeneous data\nintegration, and distributed data mining. Examples of these types of\ncollaborative classification and discovery approaches within other science\ndisciplines are presented.",

        "summary": "The combination of high spatial and spectral resolution in optical astronomy\nenables new observational approaches to many open problems in stellar and\ncircumstellar astrophysics. However, constructing a high-resolution\nspectrograph for an interferometer is a costly and time-intensive undertaking.\nOur aim is to show that, by coupling existing high-resolution spectrographs to\nexisting interferometers, one could observe in the domain of high spectral and\nspatial resolution, and avoid the construction of a new complex and expensive\ninstrument. We investigate in this article the different challenges which arise\nfrom combining an interferometer with a high-resolution spectrograph. The\nrequirements for the different sub-systems are determined, with special\nattention given to the problems of fringe tracking and dispersion. A concept\nstudy for the combination of the VLTI (Very Large Telescope Interferometer)\nwith UVES (UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph) is carried out, and several other\nspecific instrument pairings are discussed. We show that the proposed\ncombination of an interferometer with a high-resolution spectrograph is indeed\nfeasible with current technology, for a fraction of the cost of building a\nwhole new spectrograph. The impact on the existing instruments and their\nongoing programs would be minimal.",

        "summary": "The Extreme ultraviolet SpectroPhotometer (ESP) is one of five channels of\nthe Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard the NASA Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO). The ESP channel design is based on a highly stable\ndiffraction transmission grating and is an advanced version of the Solar\nExtreme ultraviolet Monitor (SEM), which has been successfully observing solar\nirradiance onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) since December\n1995. ESP is designed to measure solar Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) irradiance in\nfour first order bands of the diffraction grating centered around 19 nm, 25 nm,\n30 nm, and 36 nm, and in a soft X-ray band from 0.1 to 7.0 nm in the zeroth\norder of the grating. Each band's detector system converts the photo-current\ninto a count rate (frequency). The count rates are integrated over 0.25 sec\nincrements and transmitted to the EVE Science and Operations Center for data\nprocessing. An algorithm for converting the measured count rates into solar\nirradiance and the ESP calibration parameters are described. The ESP pre-flight\ncalibration was performed at the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility of\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology. Calibration parameters were\nused to calculate absolute solar irradiance from the Sounding Rocket flight\nmeasurements on 14 April 2008. These irradiances for the ESP bands closely\nmatch the irradiance determined for two other EUV channels flown\nsimultaneously, EVE's Multiple Euv Grating Spectrograph (MEGS) and SOHO's\nCharge, Element and Isotope Analysis System / Solar EUV Monitor (CELIAS/SEM).",

        "summary": "One of the main science goal of the future European Extremely Large Telescope\nwill be to understand the mass assembly process in galaxies as a function of\ncosmic time. To this aim, a multi-object, AO-assisted integral field\nspectrograph will be required to map the physical and chemical properties of\nvery distant galaxies. In this paper, we examine the ability of such an\ninstrument to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy of a large sample of\nmassive (0.1<Mstellar<5e11Mo) galaxies at 2<z<6, selected from future large\narea optical-near IR surveys. We produced a set of about one thousand numerical\nsimulations of 3D observations using reasonable assumptions about the site,\ntelescope, and instrument, and about the physics of distant galaxies. These\ndata-cubes were analysed as real data to produce realistic kinematic\nmeasurements of very distant galaxies. We then studied how sensible the\nscientific goals are to the observational (i.e., site-, telescope-, and\ninstrument-related) and physical (i.e., galaxy-related) parameters. We\nspecifically investigated the impact of AO performance on the science goal. We\ndid not identify any breaking points with respect to the parameters (e.g., the\ntelescope diameter), with the exception of the telescope thermal background,\nwhich strongly limits the performance in the highest (z>5) redshift bin. We\nfind that a survey of Ngal galaxies that fulfil the range of science goals can\nbe achieved with a ~90 nights program on the E-ELT, provided a multiplex\ncapability M Ngal/8.",

        "title": "Optimum Acceptance Regions for Direct Dark Matter Searches",
        "summary": "Most experiments that search for direct interactions of WIMP dark matter with\na target can distinguish the dominant electronrecoil background from the\nnuclear recoil signal, based on some discrimination parameter. An acceptance\nregion is defined inthe parameter space spanned by the recoil energy and this\ndiscrimination parameter. In the absence of a clear signal in thisregion, a\nlimit is calculated on the dark matter scattering cross section. Here, an\nalgorithm is presented that allows to define the acceptance region a priori\nsuch that the experiment has the best sensitivity. This is achieved through\noptimized acceptance regions for each WIMP model and WIMP mass that is to be\nprobed. Using recent data from the CRESST-II experiment as anexample, it is\nshown that resulting limits can be substantially stronger than those from a\nconventional acceptance region. In an experiment with a segmented target, the\nalgorithm developed here can yield different acceptance regions for the\nindividual subdetectors. Hence, it is shown how to combine the data\nconsistently within the usual Maximum Gap or Optimum Interval framework.",

        "summary": "Formation-flying studies to date have required continuous and minute\ncorrections of the orbital elements and attitudes of the spacecraft.This\nincreases the complexity, and associated risk, of controlling the formation,\nwhich often makes formation-flying studies infeasible for technological and\neconomic reasons. Passive formation-flying is a novel space-flight concept,\nwhich offers a remedy to those problems. Spacecraft in a passive formation are\nallowed to drift and rotate slowly, but by using advanced metrology and\nstatistical modelling methods, their relative positions, velocities, and\norientations are determined with very high accuracy. The metrology data is used\ndirectly by the payloads to compensate for spacecraft motions in software. The\nnormally very stringent spacecraft control requirements are thereby relaxed,\nwhich significantly reduces mission complexity and cost. Space-borne\nlow-frequency radio astronomy has been identified as a key science application\nfor a conceptual pathfinder mission using this novel approach. The mission,\ncalled FIRST (Formation-flying sub-Ionospheric Radio astronomy Science and\nTechnology) Explorer, is currently under study by the European Space Agency\n(ESA). Its objective is to demonstrate passive formation-flying and at the same\ntime perform unique world class science with a very high serendipity factor, by\nopening a new frequency window to astronomy.",

Apart from giving a brief description of these algorithms, the\nresults obtained for the above benchmark problems are presented in the paper.\nThe results suggest that while Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm yields the lowest\nRMS error for the N-bit Parity and the Two Spiral problems, Higher Order\nNeurons algorithm gives the best results for the IRIS data problem. The best\nresults for the XOR problem are obtained with the Neuro Fuzzy algorithm. The\nabove algorithms were also applied for solving several regression problems such\nas cos(x) and a few special functions like the Gamma function, the\ncomplimentary Error function and the upper tail cumulative\n$\\chi^2$-distribution function. The results of these regression problems\nindicate that, among all the ANN algorithms used in the present study,\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm yields the best results. Keeping in view the\nhighly non-linear behaviour and the wide dynamic range of these functions, it\nis suggested that these functions can be also considered as standard benchmark\nproblems for function approximation using artificial neural networks.",

We describe the construction of an\nN-dimensional grid which is suitable for generating such spectra. The\ntheoretical spectra are designed to correspond to a targeted parameter grid but\notherwise to random positions in the parameter space, and they are interpolated\non-the-fly through a pre-calculated grid of spectra. The initial grid is\ndesigned to be relatively low in parameter resolution and small in occupied\nhard disk space and therefore can be updated efficiently when a new model is\ndesired. In a pilot study of stellar population synthesis of galaxies, the mean\nsquare errors on the estimated parameters are found to decrease with the\ntargeted grid resolution. This scheme of generating a large model grid is\ngeneral for other areas of studies, particularly if they are based on\nmulti-dimensional parameter space and are focused on contrasting model\ndifferences.",

        "summary": "High contrast coronagraphic imaging of the immediate surrounding of stars\nrequires exquisite control of low-order wavefront aberrations, such as tip-tilt\n(pointing) and focus. We propose an accurate, efficient and easy to implement\ntechnique to measure such aberrations in coronagraphs which use a focal plane\nmask to block starlight. The Coronagraphic Low Order Wavefront Sensor (CLOWFS)\nproduces a defocused image of a reflective focal plane ring to measure low\norder aberrations. Even for small levels of wavefront aberration, the proposed\nscheme produces large intensity signals which can be easily measured, and\ntherefore does not require highly accurate calibration of either the detector\nor optical elements. The CLOWFS achieves nearly optimal sensitivity and is\nimmune from non-common path errors. This technique is especially well suited\nfor high performance low inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs. On\nphase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) type coronagraphs, it can\nunambiguously recover aberrations which originate from either side of the beam\nshaping introduced by the PIAA optics. We show that the proposed CLOWFS can\nmeasure sub-milliarcsecond telescope pointing errors several orders of\nmagnitude faster than would be possible in the coronagraphic science focal\nplane alone, and can also accurately calibrate residual coronagraphic leaks due\nto residual low order aberrations. We have demonstrated 1e-3 lambda/D pointing\nstability in a laboratory demonstration of the CLOWFS on a PIAA type\ncoronagraph.",

We present results obtained with a laboratory PIAA\nsystem including active wavefront control. The system has a 94.3% throughput\n(excluding coating losses) and operates in air with monochromatic light.\n  Our testbed achieved a 2.27e-7 raw contrast between 1.65 lambda/D (inner\nworking angle of the coronagraph configuration tested) and 4.4 lambda/D (outer\nworking angle). Through careful calibration, we were able to separate this\nresidual light into a dynamic coherent component (turbulence, vibrations) at\n4.5e-8 contrast and a static incoherent component (ghosts and/or polarization\nmissmatch) at 1.6e-7 contrast. Pointing errors are controlled at the 1e-3\nlambda/D level using a dedicated low order wavefront sensor.\n  While not sufficient for direct imaging of Earth-like planets from space, the\n2.27e-7 raw contrast achieved already exceeds requirements for a ground-based\nExtreme Adaptive Optics system aimed at direct detection of more massive\nexoplanets. We show that over a 4hr long period, averaged wavefront errors have\nbeen controlled to the 3.5e-9 contrast level.

        "summary": "A new wavefront sensing approach, derived from the successful curvature\nwavefront sensing concept but using a non-linear phase retrieval wavefront\nreconstruction scheme, is described. The non-linear curvature wavefront sensor\n(nlCWFS) approaches the theoretical sensitivity limit imposed by fundamental\nphysics by taking full advantage of wavefront spatial coherence in the pupil\nplane. Interference speckles formed by natural starlight encode wavefront\naberrations with the sensitivity set by the telescope's diffraction limit\nlambda/D rather than the seeing limit of more conventional linear WFSs.\nClosed-loop adaptive optics simulations show that with a nlCWFS, a 100 nm RMS\nwavefront error can be reached on a 8-m telescope on a mV = 13 natural guide\nstar. The nlCWFS technique is best suited for high precision adaptive optics on\nbright natural guide stars. It is therefore an attractive technique to consider\nfor direct imaging of exoplanets and disks around nearby stars, where achieved\nperformance is set by wavefront control accuracy, and exquisite control of low\norder aberrations is essential for high contrast coronagraphic imaging.\nPerformance gains derived from simulations are shown, and approaches for high\nspeed reconstruction algorithms are briefly discussed.",

        "summary": "Stacking analysis is a means of detecting faint sources using a priori\nposition information to estimate an aggregate signal from individually\nundetected objects. Confusion severely limits the effectiveness of stacking in\ndeep surveys with limited angular resolution, particularly at far infrared to\nsubmillimeter wavelengths, and causes a bias in stacking results. Deblending\ncorrects measured fluxes for confusion from adjacent sources; however, we find\nthat standard deblending methods only reduce the bias by roughly a factor of\ntwo while tripling the variance. We present an improved algorithm for\nsimultaneous stacking and deblending that greatly reduces bias in the flux\nestimate with nearly minimum variance. When confusion from neighboring sources\nis the dominant error, our method improves upon RMS error by at least a factor\nof three and as much as an order of magnitude compared to other algorithms.\nThis improvement will be useful for Herschel and other telescopes working in a\nsource confused, low signal to noise regime.",

        "summary": "Computation of the marginal likelihood from a simulated posterior\ndistribution is central to Bayesian model selection but is computationally\ndifficult. I argue that the marginal likelihood can be reliably computed from a\nposterior sample by careful attention to the numerics of the probability\nintegral. Posing the expression for the marginal likelihood as a Lebesgue\nintegral, we may convert the harmonic mean approximation from a sample\nstatistic to a quadrature rule. As a quadrature, the harmonic mean\napproximation suffers from enormous truncation error as consequence . In\naddition, I demonstrate that the integral expression for the harmonic-mean\napproximation converges slowly at best for high-dimensional problems with\nuninformative prior distributions. These observations lead to two\ncomputationally-modest families of quadrature algorithms that use the full\ngenerality sample posterior but without the instability. The first algorithm\nautomatically eliminates the part of the sample that contributes large\ntruncation error. The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign\nprobability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal\nlikelihood integral directly. This eliminates convergence issues. The first\nalgorithm is analogous to standard quadrature but can only be applied for\nconvergent problems. The second is a hybrid of cubature: it uses the posterior\nto discover and tessellate the subset of that sample space was explored and\nuses quantiles to compute a representive field value. Neither algorithm makes\nstrong assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution and neither is\nsensitive outliers. [abridged]",

The measured individual energy spectra of C, O, Ne, Mg,\nSi, and Fe are presented up to $\\sim 10^{14}$ eV. The spectral shape looks\nnearly the same for these primary elements and it can be fitted to an $E^{-2.66\n\\pm 0.04}$ power law in energy. Moreover, a new measurement of the absolute\nintensity of nitrogen in the 100-800 GeV/$n$ energy range with smaller errors\nthan previous observations, clearly indicates a hardening of the spectrum at\nhigh energy. The relative abundance of N/O at the top of the atmosphere is\nmeasured to be $0.080 \\pm 0.025 $(stat.)$ \\pm 0.025 $(sys.) at $\\sim $800\nGeV/$n$, in good agreement with a recent result from the first CREAM flight.",

This new computational approach\nis now possible because of advances in statistical resampling for data with\nlong-range dependence and the available performance of contemporary\nhigh-performance computing resources. We expand our earlier numerical\nevaluation to span a broader domain subset in simulated image fidelity and\nsource brightness distribution morphologies. As before, we evaluate the\nstatistical performance of the bootstrap resampling methods against direct\nMonte Carlo simulation. We find both model-based and subsample bootstrap\nmethods to continue to show significant promise for the challenging problem of\ninterferometric imaging fidelityassessment, when evaluated over the broader\ndomain subset. We report on their measured statistical performance and\nguidelines for their use and application in practice.

        "title": "Experimental evidence of water formation on interstellar dust grains",
        "summary": "The synthesis of water is one necessary step in the origin and development of\nlife. It is believed that pristine water is formed and grows on the surface of\nicy dust grains in dark interstellar clouds. Until now, there has been no\nexperimental evidence whether this scenario is feasible or not. We present here\nthe first experimental evidence of water synthesis under interstellar\nconditions. After D and O deposition on a water ice substrate (HO) held at 10\nK, we observe production of HDO and DO. The water substrate itself has an\nactive role in water formation, which appears to be more complicated than\npreviously thought. Amorphous water ice layers are the matrices where complex\norganic prebiotic species may be synthesized. This experiment opens up the\nfield of a little explored complex chemistry that could occur on interstellar\ndust grains, believed to be the site of key processes leading to the molecular\ndiversity and complexity observed in our universe.",

        "title": "Self-coherent camera as a focal plane wavefront sensor: simulations",
        "summary": "Direct detection of exoplanets requires high dynamic range imaging.\nCoronagraphs could be the solution, but their performance in space is limited\nby wavefront errors (manufacturing errors on optics, temperature variations,\netc.), which create quasi-static stellar speckles in the final image. Several\nsolutions have been suggested for tackling this speckle noise. Differential\nimaging techniques substract a reference image to the coronagraphic residue in\na post-processing imaging. Other techniques attempt to actively correct\nwavefront errors using a deformable mirror. In that case, wavefront aberrations\nhave to be measured in the science image to extremely high accuracy. We propose\nthe self-coherent camera sequentially used as a focal-plane wavefront sensor\nfor active correction and differential imaging. For both uses, stellar speckles\nare spatially encoded in the science image so that differential aberrations are\nstrongly minimized. The encoding is based on the principle of light incoherence\nbetween the hosting star and its environment. In this paper, we first discuss\none intrinsic limitation of deformable mirrors. Then, several parameters of the\nself-coherent camera are studied in detail. We also propose an easy and robust\ndesign to associate the self-coherent camera with a coronagraph that uses a\nLyot stop. Finally, we discuss the case of the association with a four-quadrant\nphase mask and numerically demonstrate that such a device enables the detection\nof Earth-like planets under realistic conditions. The parametric study of the\ntechnique lets us believe it can be implemented quite easily in future\ninstruments dedicated to direct imaging of exoplanets.",

        "summary": "In this work we present a new and efficient Bayesian method for nonlinear\nthree dimensional large scale structure inference. We employ a Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo (HMC) sampler to obtain samples from a multivariate highly\nnon-Gaussian lognormal Poissonian density posterior given a set of\nobservations. The HMC allows us to take into account the nonlinear relations\nbetween the observations and the underlying density field which we seek to\nrecover. As the HMC provides a sampled representation of the density posterior\nany desired statistical summary, such as the mean, mode or variance, can be\ncalculated from the set of samples. Further, it permits us to seamlessly\npropagate non-Gaussian uncertainty information to any final quantity inferred\nfrom the set of samples. The developed method is extensively tested in a\nvariety of test scenarios, taking into account a highly structured survey\ngeometry and selection effects. Tests with a mock galaxy catalog based on the\nmillennium run show that the method is able to recover the filamentary\nstructure of the nonlinear density field. The results further demonstrate the\nfeasibility of non-Gaussian sampling in high dimensional spaces, as required\nfor precision nonlinear large scale structure inference. The HMC is a flexible\nand efficient method, which permits for simple extension and incorporation of\nadditional observational constraints. Thus, the method presented here provides\nan efficient and flexible basis for future high precision large scale structure\ninference.",

        "summary": "The simulation of particle cascades initiated in the atmosphere by ultra high\nenergy cosmic ray particles involves the generation and propagation of a huge\namount of particles. As it is unpractical to follow every particle to its end,\nparticles below a certain energy ($E_{Cut}$) are discarded from the simulation.\nIn this article we study in detail the influence that this cut has on the total\nenergy deposited in the atmosphere by the particle cascade in AIRES\nsimulations. The energy deposit is directly related to the emission of\nfluorescence light and is critical for the accurate simulation of shower\nsignals in fluorescence detectors. Not correcting for the discarded particles\nintroduces a bias on several shower observables related to the energy deposit\nthat can range from 3 to 30% or more depending on the $E_{Cut}$ value used. A\nprescription for the correct treatment of these particles is proposed, and the\nresulting corrections to the total energy deposit are addressed, including a\nnew universal parametrization of the mean energy deposit per particle. The low\nenergy cut is introduced in the simulations to reduce the required CPU time per\nshower at the expense of simulation accuracy. We find that a 0.4 MeV cut for\nelectrons and 0.9 MeV cut for gammas is an adequate compromise, and that the\nproposed prescription is capablable of removing the bias introduced by this\ncut. The prescription is independent of the energy cut value and can be used to\ncorrect and compare simulations made with different energy cuts.",

        "summary": "The energy carried away by neutral particles in ultra high energy cosmic ray\nshowers can not be detected by fluorescence detectors. This energy is usually\nreferred to as the \"invisible energy\". Since every shower has a fraction of\ninvisible energy, the energy determined using the fluorescence technique is\nalways less than the primary energy and a correction needs to be applied. This\ncorrection, usually referred to as the \"missing energy\", can only be estimated\nusing Monte Carlo simulations.\n  In this article we study in detail the influence that discarding low energy\nparticles from the simulation has on the estimation of the missing and\ninvisible energies. We found that although the effect is not important for the\ninvisible energy,an important bias on the missing energy is introduced that can\nreach 30% or more depending on the low energy cut value.\n  We present a prescription on how to correct for this bias in AIRES\nsimulations and give a novel missing energy parametrization including results\nfor photons and for the QGSJET-II hadronic model. We also show that although\nmissing and invisible energies are closely related they are conceptually\ndifferent ideas if we consider the medium contribution to the shower energy.",

        "summary": "The number of main-sequence stars for which we can observe solar-like\noscillations is expected to increase considerably with the short-cadence\nhigh-precision photometric observations from the NASA Kepler satellite. Because\nof this increase in number of stars, automated tools are needed to analyse\nthese data in a reasonable amount of time. In the framework of the asteroFLAG\nconsortium, we present an automated pipeline which extracts frequencies and\nother parameters of solar-like oscillations in main-sequence and subgiant\nstars. The pipeline uses only the timeseries data as input and does not require\nany other input information. Tests on 353 artificial stars reveal that we can\nobtain accurate frequencies and oscillation parameters for about three quarters\nof the stars. We conclude that our methods are well suited for the analysis of\nmain-sequence stars, which show mainly p-mode oscillations.",

        "title": "Rate Coefficients for the Collisional Excitation of Molecules: Estimates\n  from an Artificial Neural Network",
        "summary": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is investigated as a tool for estimating\nrate coefficients for the collisional excitation of molecules. The performance\nof such a tool can be evaluated by testing it on a dataset of\ncollisionally-induced transitions for which rate coefficients are already\nknown: the network is trained on a subset of that dataset and tested on the\nremainder. Results obtained by this method are typically accurate to within a\nfactor ~ 2.1 (median value) for transitions with low excitation rates and ~ 1.7\nfor those with medium or high excitation rates, although 4% of the ANN outputs\nare discrepant by a factor of 10 more. The results suggest that ANNs will be\nvaluable in extrapolating a dataset of collisional rate coefficients to include\nhigh-lying transitions that have not yet been calculated. For the asymmetric\ntop molecules considered in this paper, the favored architecture is a\ncascade-correlation network that creates 16 hidden neurons during the course of\ntraining, with 3 input neurons to characterize the nature of the transition and\none output neuron to provide the logarithm of the rate coefficient.",

However, in spite of tremendous efforts by large experimental\ngroups, there is no confirmed direct detection of the dark matter in our\ngalaxy. Recent experimental results and theoretical developments suggest the\npossibility of a DM particle with mass below 10 GeV, such a particle would\nescape most of the direct searches due to the large thresholds for the\ndetection of nuclear recoils typically used. In this work we study the\npossibility of a new Dark Matter search with an unprecedented low threshold for\nthe detection of nuclear recoils using high-resistivity CCD detectors (hr-CCD).\nDue to their extremely low readout noise and the relatively large active mass,\nthese detectors present a unique opportunity in this field.",

        "title": "Spectro-Perfectionism: An Algorithmic Framework for Photon Noise-Limited\n  Extraction of Optical Fiber Spectroscopy",
        "summary": "We describe a new algorithm for the \"perfect\" extraction of one-dimensional\nspectra from two-dimensional (2D) digital images of optical fiber\nspectrographs, based on accurate 2D forward modeling of the raw pixel data. The\nalgorithm is correct for arbitrarily complicated 2D point-spread functions\n(PSFs), as compared to the traditional optimal extraction algorithm, which is\nonly correct for a limited class of separable PSFs. The algorithm results in\nstatistically independent extracted samples in the 1D spectrum, and preserves\nthe full native resolution of the 2D spectrograph without degradation. Both the\nstatistical errors and the 1D resolution of the extracted spectrum are\naccurately determined, allowing a correct chi-squared comparison of any model\nspectrum with the data. Using a model PSF similar to that found in the red\nchannel of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrograph, we compare the\nperformance of our algorithm to that of cross-section based optimal extraction,\nand also demonstrate that our method allows coaddition and foreground\nestimation to be carried out as an integral part of the extraction step. This\nwork demonstrates the feasibility of current- and next-generation multi-fiber\nspectrographs for faint galaxy surveys even in the presence of strong night-sky\nforegrounds. We describe the handling of subtleties arising from fiber-to-fiber\ncrosstalk, discuss some of the likely challenges in deploying our method to the\nanalysis of a full-scale survey, and note that our algorithm could be\ngeneralized into an optimal method for the rectification and combination of\nastronomical imaging data.",

We provide the most likely solution to the\nintegral equation that represents deprojection of the measured $I$ to $\\rho$.\nIn order to keep the solution modular, we choose to express $\\rho$ as a\nfunction of the line-of-sight (LOS) coordinate $z$. We calculate the extent of\nthe system along the ${\\bf z}$-axis, for a given point on the image that lies\nwithin an identified isophotal annulus. The extent along the LOS is binned and\ndensity is held a constant over each such $z$-bin. The code begins with a seed\ndensity and at the beginning of an iterative step, the trial $\\rho$ is updated.\nComparison of the projection of the current choice of $\\rho$ and the observed\n$I$ defines the likelihood function (which is supplemented by Laplacian\nregularisation), the maximal region of which is sought by the optimiser\n(Metropolis Hastings). The algorithm is successfully tested on a set of test\ngalaxies, the morphology of which ranges from an elliptical galaxy with varying\neccentricity to an infinitesimally thin disk galaxy marked by an abruptly\nvarying eccentricity profile. Applications are made to faint dwarf elliptical\ngalaxy Ic~3019 and another dwarf elliptical that is characterised by a central\nspheroidal nuclear component superimposed upon a more extended flattened\ncomponent. The result of deprojection of the X-ray image of triaxial cluster\nA1413 is also presented.",

A hypothesis is used that, once\nthe kB value is obtained by fitting data for particles of one kind and in some\nenergy region (e.g. for a few MeV alpha particles from internal contamination\nof a detector), it can be applied to calculate quenching factors for particles\nof another kind and for another energies (e.g. for low energy nuclear recoils)\nif all data are measured in the same experimental conditions and are treated in\nthe same way. Applicability of the method is demonstrated on many examples\nincluding materials with different mechanisms of scintillation: organic\nscintillators (solid C8H8, and liquid C16H18, C9H12); crystal scintillators\n(pure CdWO4, PbWO4, ZnWO4, CaWO4, CeF3, and doped CaF2(Eu), CsI(Tl), CsI(Na),\nNaI(Tl)); liquid noble gases (LXe).

        "summary": "The historic plates of the \"Carte du Ciel\", an international cooperative\nproject launched in 1887, offer valuable first-epoch material for the\ndetermination of absolute proper motions. We present the CdC-SF, an astrometric\ncatalogue of positions and proper motions derived from the \"Carte du Ciel\"\nplates of the San Fernando zone, photographic material with a mean epoch of\n1901.4 and a limiting magnitude of V~16, covering the declination range of\n-10deg < declination < -2deg. Digitization has been made using a conventional\nflatbed scanner. Special techniques have been developed to handle the\ncombination of plate material and the large distortion introduced by the\nscanner. The equatorial coordinates are on the ICRS defined by Tycho-2, and\nproper motions are derived using UCAC2 as second-epoch positions. The result is\na catalogue with positions and proper motions for 560000 stars, covering 1080\ndegrees squared. The mean positional uncertainty is 0.20\" (0.12\" for\nwell-measured stars) and the proper-motion uncertainty is 2.0 mas/yr (1.2\nmas/yr for well-measured stars). The proper motion catalogue CdC-SF is\neffectively a deeper extension of Hipparcos, in terms of proper motions, to a\nmagnitude of 15.",

The magnetic\nfield is expanded in a complete set of functions. The new method is based on\nthe biorthogonality of the adjoint electric current and the vector potential\nwith an inner product defined by a volume integral over the fluid domain. The\nadvantage of this method is that the velocity and the dynamo coefficients of\nthe induction and the dynamo equation do not have to be differentiated and thus\neven numerically determined tabulated values of the coefficients produce\nreasonable results. We provide test calculations and compare with published\nresults obtained by the classical treatment based on the biorthogonality of the\nmagnetic field and its adjoint. We especially consider dynamos with mean-field\ncoefficients determined from direct numerical simulations of the geodynamo and\ncompare with initial value calculations and the full MHD simulations.",

The science\nfrom both these missions contributed to three Nobel Prizes - Giacconi (2002),\nMather, and Smoot (2006). Explorers have: marked the definitive beginning of\nprecision cosmology, discovered that short gamma-ray bursts are caused by\ncompact star mergers and have measured metalicity to redshifts z>6. NASA\nExplorers do cutting-edge science that cannot be done by facility-class\ninstruments. The Explorer program provides a rapid response to changing science\nand technology, to enable cutting-edge science at moderate cost. Explorers also\nenable innovation, and engage & train scientists, managers and engineers,\nadding human capital to NASA and the nation. The astrophysics Explorer launch\nrate now being achieved is 1 per 3 years, and budget projections are in the\n$150M/year range for the next five years. A newly Vigorous Explorer Program\nshould be created to: 1. Reach the long-stated goal of annual astrophysics\nlaunches; 2. Find additional launch options for Explorers and actively\nencourage cost savings in launchers and spacecraft, such as new commercial\nvehicles and innovative partnerships. 3. Mitigate risk via stronger technical\ndevelopment and sub-orbital programs, and through longer, more thorough, Phase\nA programs, potentially reducing the need for a 30% contingency; 4. Strive to\nprotect the funding for missions that have reached Phase B, to prevent\nsignificant launch slips and cancellations, with a goal of 4 to 5 years from\nPhase B to launch; 5. Review the project management procedures and requirements\nto seek cost reductions, including the risk management strategy and the review\nand reporting process; 6. Review and possibly modify the cost caps for all\nExplorer classes to optimize scientific returns per dollar. [ABRIDGED]",

        "summary": "We assess the validity of a single step Godunov scheme for the solution of\nthe magneto-hydrodynamics equations in more than one dimension. The scheme is\nsecond-order accurate and the temporal discretization is based on the\ndimensionally unsplit Corner Transport Upwind (CTU) method of Colella. The\nproposed scheme employs a cell-centered representation of the primary fluid\nvariables (including magnetic field) and conserves mass, momentum, magnetic\ninduction and energy. A variant of the scheme, which breaks momentum and energy\nconservation, is also considered. Divergence errors are transported out of the\ndomain and damped using the mixed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning\ntechnique by Dedner et al. (J. Comput. Phys., 175, 2002). The strength and\naccuracy of the scheme are verified by a direct comparison with the eight-wave\nformulation (also employing a cell-centered representation) and with the\npopular constrained transport method, where magnetic field components retain a\nstaggered collocation inside the computational cell. Results obtained from two-\nand three-dimensional test problems indicate that the newly proposed scheme is\nrobust, accurate and competitive with recent implementations of the constrained\ntransport method while being considerably easier to implement in existing hydro\ncodes.",

In order to put\nall sectors on an equal footing, we introduce a new parameter $\\beta$, the\nsecond order running spectral index. Using the Fisher matrix formalism with and\nwithout CMB priors, we examine how the constraints vary as the parameter set is\nenlarged. We find that weak lensing with CMB priors provides robust constraints\non dark energy parameters and can simultaneously provide strong constraints on\nall three sectors. We find that the dark energy sector is largely insensitive\nto the inclusion of the other cosmological sectors. Implications for the\nplanning of future surveys are discussed.",

        "summary": "An Artificial Neural Network-based error compensation method is proposed for\nimproving the accuracy of resolver-based 16-bit encoders by compensating for\ntheir respective systematic error profiles. The error compensation procedure,\nfor a particular encoder, involves obtaining its error profile by calibrating\nit on a precision rotary table, training the neural network by using a part of\nthis data and then determining the corrected encoder angle by subtracting the\nANN-predicted error from the measured value of the encoder angle. Since it is\nnot guaranteed that all the resolvers will have exactly similar error profiles\nbecause of the inherent differences in their construction on a micro scale, the\nANN has been trained on one error profile at a time and the corresponding\nweight file is then used only for compensating the systematic error of this\nparticular encoder. The systematic nature of the error profile for each of the\nencoders has also been validated by repeated calibration of the encoders over a\nperiod of time and it was found that the error profiles of a particular encoder\nrecorded at different epochs show near reproducible behavior. The ANN-based\nerror compensation procedure has been implemented for 4 encoders by training\nthe ANN with their respective error profiles and the results indicate that the\naccuracy of encoders can be improved by nearly an order of magnitude from\nquoted values of ~6 arc-min to ~0.65 arc-min when their corresponding\nANN-generated weight files are used for determining the corrected encoder\nangle.",

        "summary": "The present operation of the ground-based network of gravitational-wave laser\ninterferometers in \"enhanced\" configuration brings the search for gravitational\nwaves into a regime where detection is highly plausible. The development of\ntechniques that allow us to discriminate a signal of astrophysical origin from\ninstrumental artefacts in the interferometer data and to extract the full range\nof information are some of the primary goals of the current work. Here we\nreport the details of a Bayesian approach to the problem of inference for\ngravitational wave observations using a network of instruments, for the\ncomputation of the Bayes factor between two hypotheses and the evaluation of\nthe marginalised posterior density functions of the unknown model parameters.\nThe numerical algorithm to tackle the notoriously difficult problem of the\nevaluation of large multi-dimensional integrals is based on a technique known\nas Nested Sampling, which provides an attractive alternative to more\ntraditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We discuss the details of\nthe implementation of this algorithm and its performance against a Gaussian\nmodel of the background noise, considering the specific case of the signal\nproduced by the in-spiral of binary systems of black holes and/or neutron\nstars, although the method is completely general and can be applied to other\nclasses of sources. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by\nintroducing a new coherence test to distinguish between the presence of a\ncoherent signal of astrophysical origin in the data of multiple instruments and\nthe presence of incoherent accidental artefacts, and the effects on the\nestimation of the source parameters as a function of the number of instruments\nin the network.",

        "summary": "Context. X-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to become\noperative at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). It is a broad-band\nmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow\nspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.\n  Aims. During the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fully\nassembled, X-shooter observed the afterglow of GRB 090313 as a demonstration of\nthe instrument's capabilities.\n  Methods. GRB 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, when\nthe object had already faded to R~21.6. Furthermore, the 90% illuminated Moon\nwas just 30 degrees away from the field. In spite of the adverse conditions, we\nobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in GRB research, covers\nsimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 Angstroms.\n  Results. The spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of\n3.3736, the redshift of the GRB. These features are composed of 3 components\nwith different ionisation levels and velocities. Some of the features have\nnever been observed before in a GRB at such a high redshift. Furthermore, we\ndetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.\n  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the potential of X-shooter in the GRB\nfield, as it was capable of observing a GRB down to a magnitude limit that\nwould include 72% of long GRB afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. Coupled\nwith the rapid response mode available at VLT, allowing reaction times of just\na few minutes, X-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on medium\nresolution spectroscopic studies of GRBs, their host galaxies and intervening\nsystems, probing the early history of the Universe.",

        "summary": "In radio astronomy, the correlator measures intensity in visibility space. In\naddition, the EoR power spectrum measured by an experiment such as the MWA is\nconstructed in visibility space. Thus, correcting for the ionosphere in the\nuv-plane instead of real space could potentially save computation. In this\npaper, we study this technique. The mathematical formula for obtaining the\nunperturbed data from the ionospherically reflected data is non-local in the\nuv-plane. Moreover, an analytic solution for the unperturbed intensity may only\nbe obtained for a limited number of expansions of the ionospheric\nperturbations. We numerically study one of these expansions (with perturbations\nas sinusoidal modes). Obtaining an analytic solution for this expansion\nrequired a Taylor expansion, and we investigate the optimal order of this\nexpansion. We also propose a number of potential computation saving techniques,\nand evaluate their pros and cons.",

        "summary": "Combined spectroscopic abundance analyses of stable and radioactive elements\ncan be applied for deriving stellar ages. The achievable precision depends on\nfactors related to spectroscopy, nucleosynthesis, and chemical evolution. We\nquantify the uncertainties arising from the spectroscopic analysis, and compare\nthese to the other error sources. We derive formulae for the age uncertainties\narising from the spectroscopic abundance analysis, and apply them to\nspectroscopic and nucleosynthetic data compiled from the literature for the Sun\nand metal-poor stars. We obtained ready-to-use analytic formulae of the age\nuncertainty for the cases of stable+unstable and unstable+unstable chronometer\npairs, and discuss the optimal relation between to-be-measured age and mean\nlifetime of a radioactive species. Application to the literature data indicates\nthat, for a single star, the achievable spectroscopic accuracy is limited to\nabout +/- 20% for the foreseeable future. At present, theoretical uncertainties\nin nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models form the precision bottleneck.\nFor stellar clusters, isochrone fitting provides a higher accuracy than\nradioactive dating, but radioactive dating becomes competitive when applied to\nmany cluster members simultaneously, reducing the statistical errors by a\nfactor sqrt(N). Spectroscopy-based radioactive stellar dating would benefit\nfrom improvements in the theoretical understanding of nucleosynthesis and\nchemical evolution. Its application to clusters can provide strong constraints\nfor nucleosynthetic models.",

        "summary": "Aims. We aim to explore the photosphere of the very cool late-type star VX\nSgr and in particular the existence and characterization of molecular layers\nabove the continuum forming photosphere. Methods. We obtained interferometric\nobservations with the VLTI/AMBER interferometer using the fringe tracker FINITO\nin the spectral domain 1.45-2.50 micron with a spectral resolution of about 35\nand baselines ranging from 15 to 88 meters.We perform independent image\nreconstruction for different wavelength bins and fit the interferometric data\nwith a geometrical toy model.We also compare the data to 1D dynamical models of\nMiras atmosphere and to 3D hydrodynamical simulations of red supergiant (RSG)\nand asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Results. Reconstructed images and\nvisibilities show a strong wavelength dependence. The H-band images display two\nbright spots whose positions are confirmed by the geometrical toy model. The\ninhomogeneities are qualitatively predicted by 3D simulations. At about 2,00\nmicron and in the region 2,35 - 2,50 micron, the photosphere appears extended\nand the radius is larger than in the H band. In this spectral region, the\ngeometrical toy model locates a third bright spot outside the photosphere that\ncan be a feature of the molecular layers. The wavelength dependence of the\nvisibility can be qualitatively explained by 1D dynamical models of Mira\natmospheres. The best-fitting photospheric models show a good match with the\nobserved visibilities and give a photospheric diameter of theta = 8,82+-0,50\nmas. The H2O molecule seems to be the dominant absorber in the molecular\nlayers. Conclusions. We show that the atmosphere of VX Sgr rather resembles\nMira/AGB star model atmospheres than RSG model atmospheres. In particular, we\nsee molecular (water) layers that are typical for Mira stars.",

This new camera achieves sub-electron read-out noise and very low\nClock Induced Charge (CIC) levels, which are mandatory for extreme faint flux\nimaging. Data gathered with the camera suggests that through enhanced\nmanufacturing processes, which would avoid traps from being created, and with\nthe help of the clock shapes producible with CCCP, the CIC generated during the\nvertical transfer could be virtually suppressed. The camera has been\ncharacterized in laboratory and used on the Observatoire du Mont M\\'egantic\n1.6-m telescope.

        "summary": "The Keck telescope's HIRES spectrograph has previously provided evidence for\na smaller fine-structure constant, alpha, compared to the current laboratory\nvalue, in a sample of 143 quasar absorption systems:\nda/a=(-0.57+/-0.11)x10^{-5}. This was based on a variety of metal-ion\ntransitions which, if alpha varies, experience different relative velocity\nshifts. This result is yet to be robustly contradicted, or confirmed, by\nmeasurements on other telescopes and spectrographs; it remains crucial to do\nso. It is also important to consider new possible instrumental systematic\neffects which may explain the Keck/HIRES results. Griest et al. (2009,\narXiv:0904.4725v1) recently identified distortions in the echelle order\nwavelength scales of HIRES with typical amplitudes +/-250m/s. Here we\ninvestigate the effect such distortions may have had on the Keck/HIRES varying\nalpha results. We demonstrate that they cause a random effect on da/a from\nabsorber to absorber because the systems are at different redshifts, placing\nthe relevant absorption lines at different positions in different echelle\norders. The typical magnitude of the effect on da/a is ~0.4x10^{-5} per\nabsorber which, compared to the median error on da/a in the sample,\n~1.9x10^{-5}, is relatively small. Consequently, the weighted mean value\nchanges by less than 0.05x10^{-5} if the corrections we calculate are applied.\nNevertheless, we urge caution, particularly for analyses aiming to achieve high\nprecision da/a measurements on individual systems or small samples, that a much\nmore detailed understanding of such intra-order distortions and their\ndependence on observational parameters is important if they are to be avoided\nor modelled reliably.

        "summary": "On the occasion of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009), we present\na new interactive dictionary of astronomy and astrophysics, which contains\nabout 7000 entries. This interdisciplinary and multicultural work is intended\nfor professional and amateur astronomers, university students in astrophysics,\nas well as terminologists and linguists. A new approach is pursued in the\nformation of a scientific dictionary, which aims to display additional\ndimensions of astronomical concepts. Although Virtual Observatories recognize\nthe necessity of efforts to define basic astronomical concepts and establish\ntheir reciprocal relations, so far they have mainly been confined to archiving\nobservational data. The present dictionary could be an incipient contribution\nto cover and inter-relate the whole astronomical lexicon beyond subfields.",

Data\nacquisition turns out to be more demanding because sensing the tip-tilt mode is\nrequired. The data reduction methodology is replaced by fitting of variance\nratios of an entire (long exposure) data set. Statistical testing of hypotheses\non outer scale models can be applied to a set of modes - supposing other noise\noriginating from detector readout and the optical train can be disentangled.",

        "summary": "The quadruple quasar H1413+117 (z_s = 2.56) has been monitored with the 2.0 m\nLiverpool Telescope in the r Sloan band from 2008 February to July. This\noptical follow-up leads to accurate light curves of the four quasar images\n(A-D), which are defined by 33 epochs of observation and an average photometric\nerror of \\sim 15 mmag. We then use the observed (intrinsic) variations of \\sim\n50-100 mmag to measure the three time delays for the lens system for the first\ntime (1\\sigma confidence intervals): \\Delta \\tau_{AB} = -17 +/- 3, \\Delta\n\\tau_{AC} = -20 +/- 4, and \\Delta \\tau_{AD} = 23 +/- 4 days (\\Delta \\tau_{ij} =\n\\tau_j - \\tau_i; B and C are leading, while D is trailing). Although time\ndelays for lens systems are often used to obtain the Hubble constant (H_0), the\nunavailability of the spectroscopic lens redshift (z_l) in the system H1413+117\nprevents a determination of H_0 from the measured delays. In this paper, the\nnew time delay constraints and a concordance expansion rate (H_0 = 70 km s^{-1}\nMpc^{-1}) allow us to improve the lens model and to estimate the previously\nunknown z_l. Our 1\\sigma estimate z_l = 1.88^{+0.09}_{-0.11} is an example of\nhow to infer the redshift of very distant galaxies via gravitational lensing.",

The sky coverage represents one of the limits of the\nexisting single reference adaptive optics system. Multiconjugate adaptive\noptics allows to overcome the limitations due to the small corrected field of\nview and the Layer Oriented approach, in particular by its Multiple Field of\nView version, increases the number of possible references using also very faint\nstars to guide the adaptive systems. In this paper we study the sky coverage\nproblem in the Layer Oriented case, using both numerical and analytical\napproaches. Taking into account a star catalogue and a star luminosity\ndistribution function we run a lot of numerical simulation sequences using the\nLayer Oriented Simulation Tool (LOST). Moreover we perform for several cases a\ndetailed optimization procedure and a relative full simulation in order to\nachieve better performance for the considered system in those particular\nconditions. In this way we can retrieve a distribution of numerically simulated\ncases that allows computing the sky coverage with respect to a performance\nparameter as the Strehl Ratio and to the scientific field size.",

        "title": "Introducing ADAPTSMOOTH, a new code for the adaptive smoothing of\n  astronomical images",
        "summary": "We introduce and publicly release a new code, ADAPTSMOOTH, which serves to\nsmooth astronomical images in an adaptive fashion, in order to enhance the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The adaptive smoothing scheme allows to take full\nadvantage of the spatially resolved photometric information contained in an\nimage in that at any location the minimal smoothing is applied to reach the\nrequested S/N. Support is given to match more images on the same smoothing\nlength, such that proper estimates of local colours can be done, with a big\npotential impact on multi-wavelength studies of extended sources (galaxies,\nnebulae). Different modes to estimate local S/N are provided. In addition to\nclassical arithmetic-mean averaging mode, the code can operate in median\naveraging mode, resulting in a significant enhancement of the final image\nquality and very accurate flux conservation. To this goal also other code\noptions are implemented and discussed in this paper. Finally, we analyze in\ngreat detail the effect of the adaptive smoothing on galaxy photometry, in\nparticular in terms of surface brightness (SB) profiles and aperture\nphotometry: deviations in SB with respect to the original image can be limited\nto <0.01 mag, with flux difference in apertures of less than 0.001 mag.",

This model takes into account a near-surface radial gradient of\nrotation which was inferred and quantified from MDI f-mode observations by\nCorbard and Thompson (2002). The effect of this observational near-surface\ngradient on the theoretical values of the surface parameters J2, J4 is\ninvestigated.

SuperAGILE is now studying the sky\nin the 18 - 60 KeV energy band. It is detecting sources with advanced imaging\nand timing detection and good spectral detection capabilities. Several\nastrophysical sources has been detected and localized, including Crab, Vela and\nGX 301-2. The instrument has the skill to resolve correctly sources in a field\nof view of [-40, +40] degrees interval, with the angular resolution of 6\narcmin, and a spectral analysis with the resolution of 8 keV. Transient events\nare regularly detected by SA with the aid of its temporal resolution (2\nmicrosec- onds) and using signal coincidence on different portions of the\ninstrument, with confirmation from other observatories. The SA data processing\nscientic software performing at the AGILE Ground Segment is divided in modules,\ngrouped in a processing pipeline named SASOA. The processing steps can be\nsummarized in data reduction, photonlist building, sources extraction and\nsources analysis. The software services allow orbital data processing (near\nreal-time), daily data set integration, Temporal Data Set (TDS) processing and\nTDS processing with source target optimization (TDS SRC). Automatic data\nprocessing monitoring and interactive data analysis is possible from an\ninternet connected worksta- tion, with the use of SA data processing Web\nservices. Many solutions were implemented in order to achieve fault tolerance.\nArchive management and data storage are performed with the help of relational\ndatabase instruments.",

The\nprinciple of CSIP detector is the photo-excitation of an intersubband\ntransition in a QW as an charge integrating gate and the signal amplification\nby another QW as a channel with very high gain, which provides us with\nextremely high responsivity (10^4 -- 10^6 A/W). It has been demonstrated that\nthe CSIP designed for the mid-infrared wavelength (14.7 um) has an excellent\nsensitivity; the noise equivalent power (NEP) of 7x10^-19 W/rHz with the\nquantum efficiency of ~2%. Advantages of the CSIP against the other highly\nsensitive detectors are, huge dynamic range of >10^6, low output impedance of\n10^3 -- 10^4 Ohms, and relatively high operation temperature (>2K). We discuss\npossible applications of the CSIP to FIR photon detection covering 35 -- 60 um\nwaveband, which is a gap uncovered with presently available photoconductors.",

I demonstrate the algorithm, ILIUM, with the estimation of\nstellar astrophysical parameters (APs) from simulations of the low resolution\nspectrophotometry to be obtained by Gaia. The AP accuracy is competitive with\nthat obtained by a support vector machine. For example, for zero extinction\nstars covering a wide range of metallicity, surface gravity and temperature,\nILIUM can estimate Teff to an accuracy of 0.3% at G=15 and to 4% for (lower\nsignal-to-noise ratio) spectra at G=20. [Fe/H] and logg can be estimated to\naccuracies of 0.1-0.4dex for stars with G<=18.5. If extinction varies a priori\nover a wide range (Av=0-10mag), then Teff and Av can be estimated quite\naccurately (3-4% and 0.1-0.2mag respectively at G=15), but there is a strong\nand ubiquitous degeneracy in these parameters which limits our ability to\nestimate either accurately at faint magnitudes. Using the forward model we can\nmap these degeneracies (in advance), and thus provide a complete probability\ndistribution over solutions. (Abridged)",

        "summary": "The Planck On-Fligh Forecaster (POFF) is a tool to predict when a position in\nthe sky will be within a selected angular distance from any receiver direction\nof the Planck satellite according to its pre-programmed observational strategy.\nThis tool has been developed in the framework of the Planck LFI Core Team\nactivities, but it is now used by the whole collaboration. In this paper we\nwill describe the tool and its applications to plan observations with other\ninstruments of point sources which are expected to enhance the possibilities of\nscientific exploitation of the Planck satellite data, once they will be\npublicly available. Collecting simultaneous multi-frequency data, like those\nthat can be planned with the POFF, will help, on one hand, to investigate\nvariability of point sources and, on the other, to reconstruct point source\nspectral energy distributions on wide frequency ranges minimizing the effects\ndue to source variability. POFF is a combination of IDL routines which combine\nthe publicly available information about the Planck scanning strategy and focal\nplane shape in order to identify if a given (list of) position(s) can be\nobservable by the satellite at a given frequency and/or by selected receivers\nin a given time range. The output can be displayed with the desired time\nresolution and selecting among various sorting options. The code is not a\nPlanck product, but it has been validated within the Planck LFI pipeline. The\ncode format and the large number of options make it flexible and suitable for\nmany applications, allowing to get results quickly. POFF is currently\nsuccessfully used to plan activities within the Planck collaboration, including\nobservations with several ground-based facilities, and it is distributed\noutside it.",

        "summary": "The MAGIC experiment, a very large Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT)\nwith sensitivity to low energy (E < 100 GeV) VHE gamma rays, has been operated\nsince 2004. It has been found that the gamma/hadron separation in IACTs becomes\nmuch more difficult below 100 GeV [Albert et al 2008] A system of two large\ntelescopes may eventually be triggered by hadronic events containing Cherenkov\nlight from only one electromagnetic subcascade or two gamma subcascades, which\nare products of the single pi^0 decay. This is a possible reason for the\ndeterioration of the experiment's sensitivity below 100 GeV. In this paper a\nsystem of two MAGIC telescopes working in stereoscopic mode is studied using\nMonte Carlo simulations. The detected images have similar shapes to that of\nprimary gamma-rays and they have small sizes (mainly below 400 photoelectrons\n(p.e.)) which correspond to an energy of primary gamma-rays below 100 GeV. The\nbackground from single or two electromagnetic subcascdes is concentrated at\nenergies below 200 GeV. Finally the number of background events is compared to\nthe number of VHE gamma-ray excess events from the Crab Nebula. The\ninvestigated background survives simple cuts for sizes below 250 p.e. and thus\nthe experiment's sensitivity deteriorates at lower energies.",

        "summary": "Radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics use the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation to describe the kinetics of photons. It is difficult to solve the\nsix-dimensional time-dependent transfer equation unless the problem is highly\nsymmetric or in equilibrium. When the radiation field is smooth, it is natural\nto take angular moments of the transfer equation to reduce the degrees of\nfreedom. However, low order moment equations contain terms that depend on\nhigher order moments. To close the system of moment equations, approximations\nare made to truncate this hierarchy. Popular closures used in astrophysics\ninclude flux limited diffusion and the M1 closure, which are rather ad hoc and\ndo not necessarily capture the correct physics. In this paper, we propose a new\nclass of closures for radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics. We start\nfrom a different perspective and highlight the consistency of a fully\nrelativistic formalism. We present a generic framework to approximate radiative\ntransfer based on relativistic Grad's moment method. We then derive a 14-field\nmethod that minimizes unphysical photon self-interaction.",

        "title": "Evaluating the Calorimeter Model with Broadband, Continuous Spectra of\n  Starburst Galaxies Observed with the Allen Telescope Array",
        "summary": "Although the relationship between the far-infrared and cm-wave radio\nluminosities of normal galaxies is one of the most striking correlations in\nastronomy, a solid understanding of its physical basis is lacking. In one\ninterpretation, the \"calorimeter model,\" rapid synchrotron cooling of cosmic\nray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship.\nObserved radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooled\nsynchrotron emission. In Thompson et al. (2006), a simple parameterized model\nis presented to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might arise\neven in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionization\nlosses and other cooling mechanisms. During the commissioning of the 42-element\nAllen Telescope Array, we observed the starburst galaxies M82, NGC 253, and Arp\n220 at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7 GHz, obtaining unprecedented broadband\ncontinuous radio spectra of these sources. We combine our observations with\nhigh-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermal\nand nonthermal components. The nonthermal components all steepen in the cm-wave\nregime and cannot be well-modeled as simple power laws. The model of Thompson\net al. is consistent with our M82 results when plausible parameters are chosen,\nand our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed model\nparameters. The model is only marginally consistent with our NGC 253 data.\nAssuming the Thompson et al. model, a steep electron energy injection index of\np = -2.5 is ruled out in M82 and NGC 253 to >99% confidence. We describe in\ndetail the observing procedures, calibration methods, analysis, and consistency\nchecks used for broadband spectral observations with the Allen Telescope Array.",

        "summary": "Physical Research Laboratory's (PRL) Optical Polarimeter has been used on\nvarious telescopes in India since its development in-house in the mid 1980s. To\nmake the instrument more efficient and effective we have designed the\nacquisition and control system and written the software to run on the GNU/Linux\nOperating System. CCD cameras have been used, in place of eyepieces, which\nallow to observe fainter sources with smaller apertures. The use of smaller\napertures provides dramatic gains in the signal-to-noise ratio. The polarimeter\nis now fully automated resulting in increased efficiency. With the advantage of\nnetworking being built-in at the operating system level in GNU/Linux, this\ninstrument can now be controlled from anywhere on the PRL local area network\nwhich means that the observer can be stationed in Ahmedabad / Thaltej as well\nor via ssh anywhere on the internet. The current report provides an overview of\nthe system as implemented.",

The aim of\nApertif is to increase the instantaneous field of view of the WSRT by a factor\nof 37 and its observing bandwidth to 300 MHz with high spectral resolution.\nThis system will turn the WSRT into an effective survey telescope with\nscientific applications such as deep imaging surveys of the northern sky of HI\nand OH emission, of the polarised continuum and efficient searches for pulsars\nand transients. Such surveys will detect the HI in more than 100,000 galaxies\nout to z = 0.4, will allow to determine the detailed structure of the magnetic\nfield of the Galaxy, and will discover more than 1,000 pulsars. We present\nexperimental results obtained with a prototype FPA installed in one of the WSRT\ndishes. These results demonstrate that FPAs do have the performance that is\nrequired to make all these surveys possible.",

        "title": "Neutron Capture Cross Sections for the Weak s Process",
        "summary": "In past decades a lot of progress has been made towards understanding the\nmain s-process component that takes place in thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant\nBranch (AGB) stars. During this process about half of the heavy elements,\nmainly between 90<=A<=209 are synthesized. Improvements were made in stellar\nmodeling as well as in measuring relevant nuclear data for a better description\nof the main s process. The weak s process, which contributes to the production\nof lighter nuclei in the mass range 56<=A<=90 operates in massive stars\n(M>=8Msolar) and is much less understood. A better characterization of the weak\ns component would help disentangle the various contributions to element\nproduction in this region. For this purpose, a series of measurements of\nneutron-capture cross sections have been performed on medium-mass nuclei at the\n3.7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator at FZK using the activation method. Also,\nneutron captures on abundant light elements with A<56 play an important role\nfor s-process nucleosynthesis, since they act as neutron poisons and affect the\nstellar neutron balance. New results are presented for the (n,g) cross sections\nof 41K and 45Sc, and revisions are reported for a number of cross sections\nbased on improved spectroscopic information.",
